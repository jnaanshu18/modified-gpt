This is done through web designing, copywriting, networking, and marketing. SEO helps create frequent, recurring, and free traffic for your website.\n\n\nWhen it comes to e-commerce websites, vivid product descriptions, customer reviews, and attractive product pictures will help bring in customers.\n\n\nMost online businesses make use of paid advertisements and social media marketing. There is nothing wrong with it, but it has a few drawbacks. You will need a continuous stream of revenue for generating Ads and persistent effort to attract your targeted audience.\n\n\nWhen it comes to SEO, it requires a one-time effort in advance without recurring expenses. Once your site gets ranked, the sales increase automatically.\n\n\nHowever, most newly set-up online businesses pay little or no attention to SEO strategies.\n\n\nVarious studies indicate that search accounts for most traffic of websites. A study by Outbrain showed that organic search beat social media by more than 300%.\n\n\nNow that we have a brief idea about SEO, let's get to the strategies.\nListing the Most Effective E-commerce SEO Strategies\nHere are a few key aspects for the best SEO strategy for E-commerce sites.\n\n\nE-commerce Keyword Analysis and Research\n\n\n\n\nThe first step to SEO campaigns is keyword research and analysis.\n\n\nThis is the most important step for developing the SEO strategy since\n1.  It will influence and inform all the other SEO tasks.\n2.  You will get target keywords that make it easy to rank.\n3.  The conversion rate is high and the search volume is satisfactory.\n4.  It is the key to unveiling the buyer's intent.\n\n\nHOW TO CONDUCT A KEYWORD RESEARCH FOR E-COMMERCE?\nThere are 3 ways to do keyword research for discovering keyword difficulty, search volume, and buyer intent- Amazon, competitor research, and SEO tools.\nAmazon: Whenever a user intends to buy a product, they go and search it on Amazon. This makes it a great resource for high buyer intent keywords. Amazon search tools also help in this process and provide free searches each day. Suppose you are setting up a small business for personalized gift items. You can start typing the seed keyword and get the keyword ideas. You can save them in your notes or a spreadsheet.\nResearching your competitors’ keywords: You can also use Google’s search engine to find high-ranking websites and derive keyword ideas from them. However, make sure that you don’t use the exact keywords blindly.\nUsing SEO tools and checkers: You can also make use of the various SEO tools available for boosting your campaigns.\nE-Commerce Website Architecture\nAfter you know the information you need, the next important aspect is your website’s architecture.\n\n\nHere are a few rules for a good site structure:\nYour e-commerce website should be simple to use and navigate.\nAny page should not be more than three clicks away from the current page.\nHave good content on your homepage, link to all product categories, and featured products.\n\n\n\n\nWhile building your website, make sure that your website has good performance. If your site takes more time than usual to load and reload, your traffic will decline.\nOn-page Optimization for E-commerce sites\nOn-page optimization is a way of certifying that your keywords fall in the right places and Google knows what your site is about.\nThere are three On-page SEO strategies for E-commerce websites.\nOn-page SEO for category pages\nOn-page SEO for product pages\nOn-page SEO for blogs\nFor this particular aspect, you should make sure that you include the target keyword in the\nMeta Title\nAlt Tag\nURL\nPage Title\nPage Headers and Subheaders\nProduct Description\nTechnical Audits for E-commerce websites\nTechnical SEO is one of those things that’s important for ALL sites… but doubly so for e-commerce. That’s because e-commerce sites tend to have LOTS of pages. And all of those pages increase the changes that technical SEO issues will crop up.\n\n\nNot only that, but most e-commerce pages don’t have that many backlinks pointing to them. This means that technical SEO is often the “tiebreaker” on Google’s first page. For example, if you and your competitor are neck-and-neck, a technical SEO issue can be the difference between the 4th spot and a coveted #1 ranking.\n\n\nHere are other SEO tools you can use for e-commerce site audits:\nSEMrush\nDeepCrawl\nScreamingFrog\nSite Condor\nSignificance of Content Marketing\n\n\nThe right content marketing strategy can help you get loads of targeted traffic and sales. You can achieve this through the three-fold method discussed below.\n\n\nExplore Your Target Customers Online\nHanging out with your customers gives you incredible insight into their thoughts, dreams, fears, and desires. Because it’s not always possible to hang out with customers in real life, I recommend going to places where they tend to hang out online.\n\n\nFor example, if your target audience is pet lovers, then you’d like to visit places like Reddit’s dog lovers’ or cat owners' community.\n\n\nUnderstand the Words and Phrases Your Target Customers Use\nNow that you’ve found your target audience, watch out for terms and phrases that they use to describe their issues and concerns.\nThese phrases represent keywords that your audience uses when they’re NOT shopping for products. These make great keywords for you to create blog content around.\n\n\nCreate Content Around That Keyword\nNow it’s time to create an engaging piece of content that’s the most definitive, useful, and absolute best on Earth.\nWhen you publish engaging content consistently on your e-commerce website, you’ll notice that all of these links, social media shares, and growing traffic, assist your product and category pages to rank better.\nHow Visual COGS can Help you Grow\nIn the arena of cut-throat competition, it is difficult to catch the attention of your target customers.\n\n\nSEO is obviously one of the best strategies to gain the attention of your target audience and get recognized. However, it's also a time-consuming method that takes months to show results.\n\n\nSo, to design an SEO campaign you’ll need insights into the performance of your pages and listings, which you can achieve through e-commerce data analytics. This is where Visual COGS can help you.\n\n\nVisual COGS is an E-commerce analytics platform designed by experts to translate raw data into actionable insights that will help you grow your e-commerce business and boost your sales.

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing. However, if Amazon is making a profit with a healthy Net PPM from your products, you may have a stronger position to negotiate price increases for Amazon.\n\n\nTips for maintaining healthy PPM\nTrack gains and losses across your product catalog and be ready to invest in products with low Net PPM numbers if you want to save them from being listed as CRAP.\nAs a vendor, you can always offer Amazon your products at lower prices to increase its profits on them.\nYou can also offer bulk buys to Amazon at discounted prices for products with low Net PPM and close to getting listed as CRAP.\nYou must use a reliable tool like Visual COGS to successfully manage the Net PPM records for all your products.\n\n\nHow can Visual COGS assist you in staying current on your Net PPM?\nVisual COGS is an excellent platform to get insights into how things like the average selling price impact Net PPM so you can successfully negotiate price increases. You can easily track the weekly, monthly, and yearly Net PPM for individual products or product groups.\nNet PPM is crucial, as it reflects Amazon's profitability over your product. Making drastic changes to improve this metric may not be necessary, but tracking Net PPM across your catalog with VisualCOGS.com can bring big changes when leveraged correctly."}

This small box includes the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, allowing one lucky vendor to stand out amongst the rest. It also shows the product’s price, shipping cost, and seller information.\n\n\nMost sales on Amazon happen through the Buy Box. Therefore, to get your products in front of customers more often than competitor products, you’ll need to win Amazon’s Buy Box.\n\n\nThe Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box is the number one factor that affects sales and profitability. Since the vast majority of sales on Amazon come through the Buy Box, vendors need to understand everything about it, including its competitive nature.\n\n\nWhile shopping online, customers click on product listings to see if the product meets their needs. If their needs are met, they then tap on the “Add to Cart” button. Customer rarely investigates the Buy Box winner, or if they do, they usually look for faster shipping or better ratings. Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box. The most common answer will be to manage all the aspects to stay ahead of other sellers. It is a huge hassle for vendors to keep track of everything on their own.\n\n\nWhat if there was a platform that gives you a complete insight into the required data and maintains it for you?\n\n\nVisual COGS provides you with data analytics, visual reports, and comprehensive dashboards—essentially, we do the hard work for you.\n\n\nOur dashboards give you Buy Box insights such as daily changes, MAP violations, Buy Box winners, other sellers, and price history so you’ll never be caught off guard.

The best way to do that is to leverage analytics to understand industry trends and customer data, thus boosting your sales and expanding your e-commerce business.\nWhat is E-commerce Analytics?\nE-commerce analytics is the process of compiling raw data and converting it into valuable insights that impact your online business allowing you to make data-driven decisions by understanding the shifts in customer behavior and trends.\n\n\nIt enables you to drive more online sales by extracting and processing crucial information across customers’ buying journeys, from discovery to conversion.\n\n\nWhy is E-commerce Analytics More Important Than Ever?\n\n\n\n\nResearch from Deloitte shows that 49% of respondents agreed that analytics enable them to make better decisions.\n\n\nTruly, Knowledge is Power!\n\n\nIn the midst of the era of digital transformation, the pandemic made us rethink our lifestyle choices.

{"prompt":"Are Amazon Chargebacks Eating Your Profits? ->","completion":" It is no surprise that Amazon has a plethora of policies in place for its vendors in order to retain strong economies of scale. Amazon will charge suppliers for practically anything they can, including packing issues and technical EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transmission mistakes.\n`\nAmazon chargebacks are the fees that Amazon charges for not complying with its requirements for packaging, fulfillment, shipping, etc. Failure to resolve these issues could cause Amazon to reject your product, return or discard it, or even stop future shipments to Amazon fulfillment centers. Therefore, Amazon vendors need to know how these fees impact their accounts and how to avoid them.\n\n\nTypes of chargebacks on Amazon\nThere can be several chargeback issues, but here are a few of them.\nASN (Advance Shipment Notification) chargeback: Failure to complete an ASN without any mistakes before your products arrive at the  Amazon fulfillment center.

This includes sending additional units or breaking the ship window rules, as well as failing to confirm POs in a timely manner.\nPackaging chargeback: These consist of many nominal charges that might be applied when you fail to pack your products systematically.\nDirect fulfillment cancellation rate chargeback: These chargebacks happen when you don’t have the inventory to fill an order Amazon places. A high cancellation rate might also harm your performance metrics and result in suspension.\nReceiving issues: Shipments that enter Amazon's fulfillment centers with compliance violations, such as barcode errors or labels with missing information, will result in these chargebacks. Therefore, ensure each shipment reaches its destination safely with features like scannable barcodes and carton labels displaying all the necessary information.\n\n\nTips to avoid Amazon chargeback\nAs an Amazon vendor, you are subject to many chargebacks from time to time.

{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing. However, if Amazon is making a profit with a healthy Net PPM from your products, you may have a stronger position to negotiate price increases for Amazon.\n\n\nTips for maintaining healthy PPM\nTrack gains and losses across your product catalog and be ready to invest in products with low Net PPM numbers if you want to save them from being listed as CRAP.\nAs a vendor, you can always offer Amazon your products at lower prices to increase its profits on them.\nYou can also offer bulk buys to Amazon at discounted prices for products with low Net PPM and close to getting listed as CRAP.\nYou must use a reliable tool like Visual COGS to successfully manage the Net PPM records for all your products.\n\n\nHow can Visual COGS assist you in staying current on your Net PPM?\nVisual COGS is an excellent platform to get insights into how things like the average selling price impact Net PPM so you can successfully negotiate price increases.

However, getting your price increase requests approved by Amazon can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get your price increase requests approved by Amazon:\n\n\nProvide a clear and concise explanation for why you are requesting a price increase. Amazon wants to know that the price increase is justified, so make sure to provide detailed information about the reasons for the request.\n\n\nConsider offering value-added services or additional product features to justify the price increase.

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com.

However, the below three essential reports can help you understand your brand’s position in depth.\nInventory Planning and Forecasting\nInventory reports are usually multi-faceted and lengthy, which makes them more essential to understand. They can help you prevent overstock, understock, and out-of-stock products that may harm your Amazon revenue and sales momentum.\nUpcoming customer demand is projected in the Inventory Planning and Forecasting report. As the season progresses, this is essential for avoiding stock issues. Therefore, this report can help you prevent a negative impact on sales caused by never-ending inventory challenges.\n\n\nYou have four types of forecasted values:\nMean Forecast: Displays Amazon’s most accurate projection based on consumer demand overall.\nP90 Forecast: This signifies that there is a 90% chance that Amazon will purchase the product up to the given demand level and a 10% possibility that they will buy more than that.\nP80 Forecast: This signifies that there is an 80% possibility that Amazon will purchase the level of demand indicated and a 20% chance that they will buy more than the demand level indicated.\nP70 Forecast: This signifies that 70% possibility of Amazon purchasing up to the amount of demand stated and a 30% chance that they will buy more than that level.\n\n\nSales  Diagnostics\nThe Sales Diagnostic report from Amazon Brand Analytics is the most comprehensive report. You can monitor how well your ASINs are selling. It displays information based on pertinent variables, including traffic, views, price information, and stock-out statistics. In addition, you can use its analytics to ascertain how to boost your sales and optimize performance.\nPurchase Orders\nVendors should keep track of purchase orders (POs) from Amazon, as it is one of the most crucial parts of their business. However, you must be mindful, if you don't confirm those purchase orders, you risk losing the orders, and since Amazon considers indicators like PO confirmation rates when evaluating vendors, you risk losing future revenue.\n\n\nChallenges With Amazon Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nAmazon Vendor Central reports could be a source of great frustration because some reports are either too complex to navigate or just don’t display the information well.

Consider signing up for third-party software to analyze your brand reports. Doing so can help you track your progress, spot trends, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nVisual COGS Reports; The Best Way Forward\n\n\nAll Amazon Vendors know the challenges of tracking their brand's performance and organizing all the data that entails.

{"prompt":"Tips to Successfully Negotiate Amazon Price Increases ->","completion":" As an Amazon Vendor, you may occasionally need to request a price increase for your products. This could be due to various factors, such as increased costs for materials, shipping, or other expenses. However, getting your price increase requests approved by Amazon can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get your price increase requests approved by Amazon:\n\n\nProvide a clear and concise explanation for why you are requesting a price increase. Amazon wants to know that the price increase is justified, so make sure to provide detailed information about the reasons for the request.\n\n\nConsider offering value-added services or additional product features to justify the price increase. For example, if you are raising the price of a product, you could offer a longer warranty or additional accessories to make the product more appealing to customers.\n\n\nBe willing to negotiate with Amazon. If your initial price increase request is denied, try to work with Amazon to find a compromise that will satisfy both parties.\nMonitor the prices of similar products on Amazon and use this information to support your request. If the prices of similar products have also increased, this can help to justify your own price increase.\n\n\nGetting your price increase requests approved by Amazon requires a combination of clear communication, value-added services, and a willingness to negotiate.

This blog will provide you with an overview of POs, Shipped COGS, and Net received. It will also show you how Visual COGS can help you stay on track with all this information.\n\n\nPurchase Orders vs. Shipped COGS vs. Net Received\n\n\nPurchase Orders:\nAmazon has a business relationship with vendors where Amazon buys products from vendors by placing POs. As a vendor, you are expected to accept all of Amazon’s POs, but that largely depends on how well you manage your inventory and understand demand forecasts. Tools like Visual COGS analyze demand forecasts to make sure you are always ready for unexpected POs.\n\n\nShipped COGS:\nShipped COGS is Amazon’s cost of goods sold to the customer. It’s typically the metric vendors care most about on a daily basis because it indicates how well their products are selling on Amazon.\n\n\nNet Received:\nNet Received is the net amount the vendor receives after fulfilling Amazon’s purchase orders. These numbers are directly related to your receive fill rate. The more POs you accept, the more money you will make.\n\n\nVisual COGS: a one-stop destination\n\n\nSelling on Amazon means dealing with factors like POs, Shipped COGS, and Net Received.

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Amazon Vendor Central: The Ultimate Guide to Win Amazon’s Buy Box in 2022 ->","completion":" In 2020 Amazon’s net sales revenue was $386 billion, of which $320 billion in those sales were from their Buy Box. That is approximately 83% of the total revenue registered. This figure clearly shows the impact the Buy Box can have on the net revenue generated and how it can accelerate the performance of your business.\n\n\n(Source: https:\/\/youramzseller.com\/blog\/winning-amazon-buy-box-in-2021)\n\n\nThus, Amazon sellers need to understand the Buy Box.

This small box includes the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, allowing one lucky vendor to stand out amongst the rest. It also shows the product’s price, shipping cost, and seller information.\n\n\nMost sales on Amazon happen through the Buy Box. Therefore, to get your products in front of customers more often than competitor products, you’ll need to win Amazon’s Buy Box.\n\n\nThe Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box is the number one factor that affects sales and profitability. Since the vast majority of sales on Amazon come through the Buy Box, vendors need to understand everything about it, including its competitive nature.\n\n\nWhile shopping online, customers click on product listings to see if the product meets their needs. If their needs are met, they then tap on the “Add to Cart” button. Customer rarely investigates the Buy Box winner, or if they do, they usually look for faster shipping or better ratings. Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box. The most common answer will be to manage all the aspects to stay ahead of other sellers. It is a huge hassle for vendors to keep track of everything on their own.\n\n\nWhat if there was a platform that gives you a complete insight into the required data and maintains it for you?\n\n\nVisual COGS provides you with data analytics, visual reports, and comprehensive dashboards—essentially, we do the hard work for you.\n\n\nOur dashboards give you Buy Box insights such as daily changes, MAP violations, Buy Box winners, other sellers, and price history so you’ll never be caught off guard. Another interesting element of Visual COGS is our competitor feature. It allows you to compare prices and the availability of competing products so that you can adjust your strategy and take appropriate action to stay ahead in the race to own market share.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIt is essential to provide the best customer experience to sustain a healthy Buy Box share. Staying updated with everyday changes and finding a suitable price point is one of the most challenging things for a vendor. To succeed in such a competitive arena, vendors need to be aware of the latest Amazon policies, advertising trends, market forecasts, and business strategies, along with insights into all the factors that determine the Buy Box winner. Sounds complex, right?\n\n\nVisual COGS is here to make things simple by providing systematic and clear insights to help you keep track of daily changes, price fluctuations, and other factors determining the Buy Box winner.

Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com.

It's a presentation of roadshow products and services by Costco Vendors to Members and Buyers.\nWhen it comes to being a Costco Vendor, keep the following three factors in mind:\nCostco expects its vendors to prohibit illegal child labor, forced labor, and physical abuse of workers.\nCostco expects its vendors to follow the country's applicable labor and environmental laws and regulations where the merchandise gets produced.\nCostco encourages its vendors to work toward \"Above and Beyond Goals,\" which are continuous improvements in employee working conditions and environmental protection.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Becoming a Costco Vendor?\n\n\nIn 2021, Costco sold around $192 billion worth of merchandise and brought $3.9 billion worth of sales from membership fees. \n\n\nSo, where does Costco make its money?\nPart of the money comes from subscriptions, which are reliable and reduce theft.\n\n\nFor comparison, below are some of their membership sales and pricing, as well as average sales per warehouse:\n$60 for a Costco Business Membership.\n$60 for a Costco Gold Star Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Business Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Gold Star Membership.\nSuccess Strategies for a Costco Vendor\nMaintaining your business partnership with Costco necessitates continued sales and adherence to the company's rules and conditions.

{"prompt":"Three Noteworthy Amazon Vendor Central Reports For Your Progressive Business ->","completion":" On Amazon, it is critical for vendors to maximize efficiency and comprehend their consumer bases. Understanding the data as a whole is the best way to do it. Many vital measures required for your business growth are available in Amazon Vendor Central reports.\nAmazon reports provide vendors with crucial information to highlight the most critical facets of their business. In addition, these reports provide a complete summary of your brand performance, the best selling products, and other relevant information.  \n\n\nImportance of Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nMaking significant changes to your Amazon operations requires a firm grasp of crucial data. Imagine, if you don’t have any data to draw upon, how will you determine what is adequate for your brand? Or even if you have access to data, it won’t be enough to make any difference to your business until you understand it correctly. So, here is where Amazon Vendor Central reports come into play.\n\n\nVendor Central reports provide insight into the brand performance, which is impossible to track anywhere else. These reports furnish invaluable data about what works for your brand on Amazon (and what doesn’t). You can maintain and track all your business reports to serve your customers and maximize sales.\n\n\nThree Notable Reports of Amazon Vendor Central\n\n\nVendor Central has various types of reports to monitor your brand performance. However, the below three essential reports can help you understand your brand’s position in depth.\nInventory Planning and Forecasting\nInventory reports are usually multi-faceted and lengthy, which makes them more essential to understand. They can help you prevent overstock, understock, and out-of-stock products that may harm your Amazon revenue and sales momentum.\nUpcoming customer demand is projected in the Inventory Planning and Forecasting report. As the season progresses, this is essential for avoiding stock issues. Therefore, this report can help you prevent a negative impact on sales caused by never-ending inventory challenges.\n\n\nYou have four types of forecasted values:\nMean Forecast: Displays Amazon’s most accurate projection based on consumer demand overall.\nP90 Forecast: This signifies that there is a 90% chance that Amazon will purchase the product up to the given demand level and a 10% possibility that they will buy more than that.\nP80 Forecast: This signifies that there is an 80% possibility that Amazon will purchase the level of demand indicated and a 20% chance that they will buy more than the demand level indicated.\nP70 Forecast: This signifies that 70% possibility of Amazon purchasing up to the amount of demand stated and a 30% chance that they will buy more than that level.\n\n\nSales  Diagnostics\nThe Sales Diagnostic report from Amazon Brand Analytics is the most comprehensive report. You can monitor how well your ASINs are selling. It displays information based on pertinent variables, including traffic, views, price information, and stock-out statistics. In addition, you can use its analytics to ascertain how to boost your sales and optimize performance.\nPurchase Orders\nVendors should keep track of purchase orders (POs) from Amazon, as it is one of the most crucial parts of their business. However, you must be mindful, if you don't confirm those purchase orders, you risk losing the orders, and since Amazon considers indicators like PO confirmation rates when evaluating vendors, you risk losing future revenue.\n\n\nChallenges With Amazon Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nAmazon Vendor Central reports could be a source of great frustration because some reports are either too complex to navigate or just don’t display the information well. Here are some of the challenges you may encounter.\nThe first challenge is understanding all of the different types of reports available. There are sales reports, inventory reports, performance reports, and more. It can be difficult to know which report you need to look at to get the information you need.\nAnother challenge is that some of the reports are not updated in real time. This can make it difficult to track your progress and see how your business is doing.\nFinally, some of the reports can be confusing or difficult to interpret. This can make it challenging to spot trends or identify areas that need improvement.\nDespite these challenges, it is important to review your Vendor Central reports regularly. Consider signing up for third-party software to analyze your brand reports. Doing so can help you track your progress, spot trends, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nVisual COGS Reports; The Best Way Forward\n\n\nAll Amazon Vendors know the challenges of tracking their brand's performance and organizing all the data that entails.

{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing. However, if Amazon is making a profit with a healthy Net PPM from your products, you may have a stronger position to negotiate price increases for Amazon.\n\n\nTips for maintaining healthy PPM\nTrack gains and losses across your product catalog and be ready to invest in products with low Net PPM numbers if you want to save them from being listed as CRAP.\nAs a vendor, you can always offer Amazon your products at lower prices to increase its profits on them.\nYou can also offer bulk buys to Amazon at discounted prices for products with low Net PPM and close to getting listed as CRAP.\nYou must use a reliable tool like Visual COGS to successfully manage the Net PPM records for all your products.\n\n\nHow can Visual COGS assist you in staying current on your Net PPM?\nVisual COGS is an excellent platform to get insights into how things like the average selling price impact Net PPM so you can successfully negotiate price increases. You can easily track the weekly, monthly, and yearly Net PPM for individual products or product groups.\nNet PPM is crucial, as it reflects Amazon's profitability over your product. Making drastic changes to improve this metric may not be necessary, but tracking Net PPM across your catalog with VisualCOGS.com can bring big changes when leveraged correctly."}
{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com.

{"prompt":"Six Omnichannel Trends for your Business in 2022 ->","completion":" You’re looking for the perfect dress to rock your prom night. Do you just buy the first dress you try on, go hopping from store to store trying on a plethora of dresses, or do you make an online purchase?\n\n\nMost customers explore multiple channels before making a final purchase. About 86% of shoppers regularly channel-hop across at least two channels. This is why successful brands adopt an omnichannel approach as one of their main strategies.\n\n\nIn a world where customers are the kings, omnichannel marketing has grown vital to implement a customer-centric mantra for your growing brand.\n\n\nWhat’s Omnichannel Marketing?\nOmnichannel marketing is the seamless integration of all online and offline touchpoints (physical stores and websites), branding, and messaging for an enhanced customer experience and a consistent brand experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of the omnichannel approach include buying online and picking up in-store or buying at the store and getting it delivered.\n\n\nAbout 87% of the retailers acknowledge the importance of omnichannel marketing strategy for their business. \n\n\nSo, How can you achieve this?\n\n\nThe goal is to ensure that each time your customers interact with your brand, across any channel, the message you’re trying to convey to them is consistent and relevant. Through omnichannel marketing, you can create:\nConsistent and engaging branding\nPersonalized messaging based on the customer’s interests\nDynamic content based on past interactions and the customer’s present buying stage.\n\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Omnichannel Marketing?\n\n\nEnhanced User Experience and Customer Satisfaction\nBusinesses using an omnichannel approach experience a 90% higher retention rate than businesses using single-channel campaigns.\n\n\nCustomers buy from brands they can trust. Omnichannel marketing enables brands to create a consistent user experience across multiple platforms. By providing a personalized user experience, the customer feels known and valued, which increases customer satisfaction, boosting loyalty and retention.\n\n\nCohesive Brand Identity\nAn omnichannel approach helps ensure consistency on cross-channel platforms. Not only does this help form a consistent and cohesive brand identity, but it also forms a strong brand recall. \n\n\nThis strengthened brand recall dramatically increases the probability of purchases across your customer base.\n\n\nMaximize Your ROI\nBy fostering brand loyalty, customer retention, strong brand recall, and enhanced customer satisfaction, you’ll be able to attract new customers through word-of-mouth marketing, good recommendations, and positive reviews. More customers mean more business, and therefore, more revenue.\n\n\nOmnichannel Trends to Watchout for in 2022\nMore people are shopping digitally than ever before. There are about 2.14 billion online shoppers, which account for almost 30% of the world’s population.\n\n\nTo keep up with the evolving marketplace and capture the attention of your customers, here are the six latest omnichannel trends to grow your business.\n\n\nBetter Personalization: The Key to Improved Customer Relationships\nAccording to a report by HubSpot, 79% of customers stated that personalized customer service is more significant than marketing.\n\n\nWhen your organization opts for an omnichannel marketing strategy, the most critical aspect is to put your customers' interests first. A personalized approach will gain you loyal customers and numerous referrals.\n\n\nMicrosoft revealed that 96% of customers say customer service is essential for loyalty to a particular brand. You can provide a personal touch by training your customer-facing team about the importance of personalized communication. Your customers will expect you to know:\nTheir name and location\nPast conversations\nTheir previous purchases\nA unified and personalized experience will not only favor trust and loyalty but will gain you positive reviews and referrals. For example, the Customer Expectations Report of 2020 released by HubSpot revealed that 77% of your satisfied customers would refer others to your organization.\n\n\nAR Applications: Adding the ‘Element of Touch’\nOne of the best ways to give a personal touch is Augmented Reality (AR). It will help customers connect with your products, allowing them to imagine how these products will fit into their lives.\n\n\nSeveral brands like Shopify, Target, IKEA and The Home Depot have embedded AR in their customers' shopping experience. Here are some examples of how marketers apply AR technology.\nThey help you try on spectacles, sunglasses, apparel, and accessories to see if they suit you.\nFilters from social media let you test hair dye to see how you’ll look with a new color.\nApps give you a preview of how a particular piece of furniture, like a table or sofa, will fit into your living space.\nBrick-and-Mortar Space: Making a Comeback\nPhysical stores are here to stay. Many people still prefer in-person shopping. This provides an opportunity to establish your presence in local communities while adding another sales channel into the mix.\n\n\nAbout 89% of women and 78% of men who visit offline stores stated that they add extra items while they shop beyond their specified requirement. This shows that the trend of impulse buying is active and customers are more likely to add to their shopping cart once inside an offline shop.\n\n\nAround 59% of customers state that they’re likely to look at a product online and buy in-store. So, by blending the offline and online customer experiences, brands can provide an ultimate omnichannel experience.\n\n\nVideo Content and Shoppable Videos: Engage Customers Dynamically\n\n\nShoppable videos and other video content are crucial omnichannel marketing trends to watch for in 2022.\n\n\nCisco states that videos will constitute 82% of all online traffic by 2022. Consumers are around 85% more likely to buy a product after watching a video about it.\n\n\nThe above data indicates that selling through video content is to become a significant trend.\nYou may be aware of the digital trend allowing Instagram users to tap on posts to purchase products simply. Shoppable videos work the same way. They help promoters target particular segments without the advertisement feeling intrusive.\n\n\nContactless Transactions: Digital is the New Norm\nRetailers and brands design in-store applications to ensure contactless transactions. An in-store application provides a virtual shopping experience to its customers by encapsulating all essential functions in a suitable way.\n\n\nConsumers with many touchpoints will expect more options at each stage, from pickup options, delivery, and logistics to the point of purchases and social distancing protocols.\n\n\nApply Customer Data Offline: Nailing your Data-Driven Strategies\nA report by Harvard Business Review showed that 73% of the customers use multiple channels in their shopping journey.\n\n\nThe direct-to-customer brand always has the advantage of leveraging data to improve customer relationships. Applying leveraged customer data to other channels will create effective promotions, more conversions, improved product development information, and strengthen consumer relationships.\n\n\nResearch has shown nine out of 10 customers prefer the omnichannel experience.\nThe pandemic has brought significant changes in shopping behaviors and trends, which are likely to continue even after the threat of contagion is over. Providing a seamless and unified customer experience through omnichannel marketing is essential.\n\n\nTake Your Business to The Next Level\nTo leverage omnichannel marketing, the most crucial aspect is data collection and analytics, but without a team and the necessary infrastructure to translate data into actionable insights, it is all useless.\n\n\nVisual COGS is the ultimate analytics platform built to uncover valuable insights for e-commerce brands. By deploying an analytics platform, like Visual COGS, you can distill data in real-time, allowing your business to quickly course correct while running omnichannel campaigns and meeting your customers' needs.\n\n\nClick on this link to request a demo now!"}
{"prompt":"A Quick Overview: Purchase Orders, Shipped COGS, and Net Received ->","completion":" As an Amazon vendor, you must deal with information like Purchase Orders (POs), Shipped COGS, and Net Received. Understanding these crucial KPIs enable you to make critical decisions concerning sales velocity and inventory management.\nVendor Central contains this information but getting to it and deciphering the results across multiple spreadsheets can take time and effort.  This blog will provide you with an overview of POs, Shipped COGS, and Net received. It will also show you how Visual COGS can help you stay on track with all this information.\n\n\nPurchase Orders vs. Shipped COGS vs. Net Received\n\n\nPurchase Orders:\nAmazon has a business relationship with vendors where Amazon buys products from vendors by placing POs. As a vendor, you are expected to accept all of Amazon’s POs, but that largely depends on how well you manage your inventory and understand demand forecasts. Tools like Visual COGS analyze demand forecasts to make sure you are always ready for unexpected POs.\n\n\nShipped COGS:\nShipped COGS is Amazon’s cost of goods sold to the customer. It’s typically the metric vendors care most about on a daily basis because it indicates how well their products are selling on Amazon.\n\n\nNet Received:\nNet Received is the net amount the vendor receives after fulfilling Amazon’s purchase orders. These numbers are directly related to your receive fill rate. The more POs you accept, the more money you will make.\n\n\nVisual COGS: a one-stop destination\n\n\nSelling on Amazon means dealing with factors like POs, Shipped COGS, and Net Received. It’s important that vendors identify trends and insights to improve their Amazon business but this is no easy task.\nVisual COGS manages all your important data and provides you with valuable information in the form of simplified charts and graphs so you don’t have to spend your time buried in Pivot Tables. Visual COGS tracks daily trends across KPIs like Purchase Orders, Shipped COGS, Net Received, Buy Box status, and Demand Forecasts. Sign up for a 14-day free trial today."}
{"prompt":"Maximizing Profitability: Data for Price Increases on Amazon ->","completion":" \n\nAmazon Vendors can use Average Selling Price and Net Product Margin to advocate for price increases with their Vendor Manager by providing data that shows the financial performance of their products.\n\n\nAverage Selling Price (ASP) is the average price at which a product sells on Amazon. By tracking the ASP of their products, vendors can see if they are selling at a competitive price compared to similar products in the market. If the ASP is lower than the industry average, vendors can use this data to show that they need to increase their prices to remain competitive.\nNet Pure Product Margin (PPM) is the profit margin Amazon earned on a product after accounting for all costs associated with that product. By tracking PPM, vendors can see how much profit Amazon is earning on each product. If PPM is high, it can indicate that Amazon can tolerate a price increase and retain profitability.\n\n\nWhen advocating for a price increase, vendors should present data on both ASP and PPM to their Vendor Manager. By showing that the ASP is lower than the industry average and that PPM is high, vendors can make a compelling case for a price increase.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that vendors can also advocate for price increases by showing how they are providing value to Amazon and its customers through things such as innovation, better quality products, or exceptional customer service.\n\n\nWith Visual COGS, vendors can have a powerful tool that tracks both ASP and Net PPM, providing them with the data they need to successfully advocate for price increases. It is an all-in-one Amazon Vendor Central solution that provides charts, graphs, and other features to help vendors monitor the financial performance of their products, and make data-driven decisions about pricing. This can give vendors an edge in negotiations with their Vendor Manager, and help them to maintain profitability while providing the best prices to customers."}
{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy.

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com. For tips and tricks to improve the SEO of your e-commerce website, read this blog.\n\n\nProgram for Supplier Diversity\nCostco is committed to creating opportunities for eligible local minority-owned and women-owned suppliers in their business areas and its Costco Vendor program.\n\n\nCostco Roadshow\nCostco Roadshow is a regular event for the retail warehouse giant's members. It's a presentation of roadshow products and services by Costco Vendors to Members and Buyers.\nWhen it comes to being a Costco Vendor, keep the following three factors in mind:\nCostco expects its vendors to prohibit illegal child labor, forced labor, and physical abuse of workers.\nCostco expects its vendors to follow the country's applicable labor and environmental laws and regulations where the merchandise gets produced.\nCostco encourages its vendors to work toward \"Above and Beyond Goals,\" which are continuous improvements in employee working conditions and environmental protection.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Becoming a Costco Vendor?\n\n\nIn 2021, Costco sold around $192 billion worth of merchandise and brought $3.9 billion worth of sales from membership fees. \n\n\nSo, where does Costco make its money?\nPart of the money comes from subscriptions, which are reliable and reduce theft.\n\n\nFor comparison, below are some of their membership sales and pricing, as well as average sales per warehouse:\n$60 for a Costco Business Membership.\n$60 for a Costco Gold Star Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Business Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Gold Star Membership.\nSuccess Strategies for a Costco Vendor\nMaintaining your business partnership with Costco necessitates continued sales and adherence to the company's rules and conditions. Here are a few points that are going to help you get there.\nTo avoid supply shortages, be prepared to manufacture bulk products. Costco may terminate your membership if you continue to disappoint in supply and face shortages in quantities of items.\nGive a decent description of your item no fewer than 100 words for online sales to attract online shoppers and impulse-buy shoppers.\nInvest in the items that are in high demand among your subscribers.\nAllow Costco's marketing expertise to promote your items.\nEnsure that the quality of any item does not suffer. This may result in the termination of your business relationship.\nSkyrocket Your Growth in Costco with Visual COGS\nJust started out as a Costco vendor?\n\n\nWe bring you Visual COGS, an e-commerce data analytics tool designed for sellers on Costco.com to surface actionable insights.

This small box includes the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, allowing one lucky vendor to stand out amongst the rest. It also shows the product’s price, shipping cost, and seller information.\n\n\nMost sales on Amazon happen through the Buy Box. Therefore, to get your products in front of customers more often than competitor products, you’ll need to win Amazon’s Buy Box.\n\n\nThe Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box is the number one factor that affects sales and profitability. Since the vast majority of sales on Amazon come through the Buy Box, vendors need to understand everything about it, including its competitive nature.\n\n\nWhile shopping online, customers click on product listings to see if the product meets their needs. If their needs are met, they then tap on the “Add to Cart” button. Customer rarely investigates the Buy Box winner, or if they do, they usually look for faster shipping or better ratings. Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box. The most common answer will be to manage all the aspects to stay ahead of other sellers. It is a huge hassle for vendors to keep track of everything on their own.\n\n\nWhat if there was a platform that gives you a complete insight into the required data and maintains it for you?\n\n\nVisual COGS provides you with data analytics, visual reports, and comprehensive dashboards—essentially, we do the hard work for you.\n\n\nOur dashboards give you Buy Box insights such as daily changes, MAP violations, Buy Box winners, other sellers, and price history so you’ll never be caught off guard. Another interesting element of Visual COGS is our competitor feature. It allows you to compare prices and the availability of competing products so that you can adjust your strategy and take appropriate action to stay ahead in the race to own market share.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIt is essential to provide the best customer experience to sustain a healthy Buy Box share. Staying updated with everyday changes and finding a suitable price point is one of the most challenging things for a vendor. To succeed in such a competitive arena, vendors need to be aware of the latest Amazon policies, advertising trends, market forecasts, and business strategies, along with insights into all the factors that determine the Buy Box winner. Sounds complex, right?\n\n\nVisual COGS is here to make things simple by providing systematic and clear insights to help you keep track of daily changes, price fluctuations, and other factors determining the Buy Box winner.

Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}

You will need a continuous stream of revenue for generating Ads and persistent effort to attract your targeted audience.\n\n\nWhen it comes to SEO, it requires a one-time effort in advance without recurring expenses. Once your site gets ranked, the sales increase automatically.\n\n\nHowever, most newly set-up online businesses pay little or no attention to SEO strategies.\n\n\nVarious studies indicate that search accounts for most traffic of websites. A study by Outbrain showed that organic search beat social media by more than 300%.\n\n\nNow that we have a brief idea about SEO, let's get to the strategies.\nListing the Most Effective E-commerce SEO Strategies\nHere are a few key aspects for the best SEO strategy for E-commerce sites.\n\n\nE-commerce Keyword Analysis and Research\n\n\n\n\nThe first step to SEO campaigns is keyword research and analysis.\n\n\nThis is the most important step for developing the SEO strategy since\n1.  It will influence and inform all the other SEO tasks.\n2.  You will get target keywords that make it easy to rank.\n3.  The conversion rate is high and the search volume is satisfactory.\n4.  It is the key to unveiling the buyer's intent.\n\n\nHOW TO CONDUCT A KEYWORD RESEARCH FOR E-COMMERCE?\nThere are 3 ways to do keyword research for discovering keyword difficulty, search volume, and buyer intent- Amazon, competitor research, and SEO tools.\nAmazon: Whenever a user intends to buy a product, they go and search it on Amazon. This makes it a great resource for high buyer intent keywords. Amazon search tools also help in this process and provide free searches each day. Suppose you are setting up a small business for personalized gift items. You can start typing the seed keyword and get the keyword ideas. You can save them in your notes or a spreadsheet.\nResearching your competitors’ keywords: You can also use Google’s search engine to find high-ranking websites and derive keyword ideas from them. However, make sure that you don’t use the exact keywords blindly.\nUsing SEO tools and checkers: You can also make use of the various SEO tools available for boosting your campaigns.\nE-Commerce Website Architecture\nAfter you know the information you need, the next important aspect is your website’s architecture.\n\n\nHere are a few rules for a good site structure:\nYour e-commerce website should be simple to use and navigate.\nAny page should not be more than three clicks away from the current page.\nHave good content on your homepage, link to all product categories, and featured products.\n\n\n\n\nWhile building your website, make sure that your website has good performance. If your site takes more time than usual to load and reload, your traffic will decline.\nOn-page Optimization for E-commerce sites\nOn-page optimization is a way of certifying that your keywords fall in the right places and Google knows what your site is about.\nThere are three On-page SEO strategies for E-commerce websites.\nOn-page SEO for category pages\nOn-page SEO for product pages\nOn-page SEO for blogs\nFor this particular aspect, you should make sure that you include the target keyword in the\nMeta Title\nAlt Tag\nURL\nPage Title\nPage Headers and Subheaders\nProduct Description\nTechnical Audits for E-commerce websites\nTechnical SEO is one of those things that’s important for ALL sites… but doubly so for e-commerce. That’s because e-commerce sites tend to have LOTS of pages. And all of those pages increase the changes that technical SEO issues will crop up.\n\n\nNot only that, but most e-commerce pages don’t have that many backlinks pointing to them. This means that technical SEO is often the “tiebreaker” on Google’s first page. For example, if you and your competitor are neck-and-neck, a technical SEO issue can be the difference between the 4th spot and a coveted #1 ranking.\n\n\nHere are other SEO tools you can use for e-commerce site audits:\nSEMrush\nDeepCrawl\nScreamingFrog\nSite Condor\nSignificance of Content Marketing\n\n\nThe right content marketing strategy can help you get loads of targeted traffic and sales. You can achieve this through the three-fold method discussed below.\n\n\nExplore Your Target Customers Online\nHanging out with your customers gives you incredible insight into their thoughts, dreams, fears, and desires. Because it’s not always possible to hang out with customers in real life, I recommend going to places where they tend to hang out online.\n\n\nFor example, if your target audience is pet lovers, then you’d like to visit places like Reddit’s dog lovers’ or cat owners' community.\n\n\nUnderstand the Words and Phrases Your Target Customers Use\nNow that you’ve found your target audience, watch out for terms and phrases that they use to describe their issues and concerns.\nThese phrases represent keywords that your audience uses when they’re NOT shopping for products. These make great keywords for you to create blog content around.\n\n\nCreate Content Around That Keyword\nNow it’s time to create an engaging piece of content that’s the most definitive, useful, and absolute best on Earth.\nWhen you publish engaging content consistently on your e-commerce website, you’ll notice that all of these links, social media shares, and growing traffic, assist your product and category pages to rank better.\nHow Visual COGS can Help you Grow\nIn the arena of cut-throat competition, it is difficult to catch the attention of your target customers.\n\n\nSEO is obviously one of the best strategies to gain the attention of your target audience and get recognized.

{"prompt":"Tips to Successfully Negotiate Amazon Price Increases ->","completion":" As an Amazon Vendor, you may occasionally need to request a price increase for your products. This could be due to various factors, such as increased costs for materials, shipping, or other expenses. However, getting your price increase requests approved by Amazon can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get your price increase requests approved by Amazon:\n\n\nProvide a clear and concise explanation for why you are requesting a price increase. Amazon wants to know that the price increase is justified, so make sure to provide detailed information about the reasons for the request.\n\n\nConsider offering value-added services or additional product features to justify the price increase. For example, if you are raising the price of a product, you could offer a longer warranty or additional accessories to make the product more appealing to customers.\n\n\nBe willing to negotiate with Amazon. If your initial price increase request is denied, try to work with Amazon to find a compromise that will satisfy both parties.\nMonitor the prices of similar products on Amazon and use this information to support your request. If the prices of similar products have also increased, this can help to justify your own price increase.\n\n\nGetting your price increase requests approved by Amazon requires a combination of clear communication, value-added services, and a willingness to negotiate.

{"prompt":"How to Leverage E-commerce Analytics to Augment Sales ->","completion":" \n\nDue to the rapid evolution of digital transformation, businesses selling products online have seen a staggering amount of growth.\n\n\nThe drawback of this explosive growth is the rise of numerous competitors. E-commerce vendors and sellers must understand all the dimensions of e-commerce strategies to stay on top.\nIn e-commerce businesses, not only are your customers royalty, but they also have all the power you need to grow your business. The best way to do that is to leverage analytics to understand industry trends and customer data, thus boosting your sales and expanding your e-commerce business.\nWhat is E-commerce Analytics?\nE-commerce analytics is the process of compiling raw data and converting it into valuable insights that impact your online business allowing you to make data-driven decisions by understanding the shifts in customer behavior and trends.\n\n\nIt enables you to drive more online sales by extracting and processing crucial information across customers’ buying journeys, from discovery to conversion.\n\n\nWhy is E-commerce Analytics More Important Than Ever?\n\n\n\n\nResearch from Deloitte shows that 49% of respondents agreed that analytics enable them to make better decisions.\n\n\nTruly, Knowledge is Power!\n\n\nIn the midst of the era of digital transformation, the pandemic made us rethink our lifestyle choices. With lockdowns across the globe, online sales grew rapidly as customers changed their buying habits, a trend that will be around for a long time and is expected to keep growing.\n\n\nE-commerce sales in the US are set to surpass $1 trillion, making up 18% of total retail sales by 2024.\n\n\nBenefits of Analytics for E-commerce\nYou will reap several benefits from using e-commerce analytics for your online shop.\n\n\n\n\nOptimize Pricing\nEighty percent of people say that competitive pricing is the most important aspect of shopping online.\n\n\nE-commerce data analytics empowers you with actionable insights that help you visualize sales for each customer segment at a granular level. You can leverage this data to understand the best prices at the product level to optimize costs and earn maximum revenue.\n\n\nOptimize Inventory Performance\nUnderestimating consumer demand will lead to insufficient inventory and customer dissatisfaction. In contrast, overestimating demand will lead to overstock, creating unnecessary manufacturing and storage costs.\n\n\nE-commerce analytics gives you the bigger picture so you can analyze demand versus inventory and optimize your sell-through performance.\n\n\nCustomer Insights to Personalize Experiences\nRemember the time you visited the neighborhood’s friendly general store or when an assistant in your go-to shopping place helped you throughout your buying experience?\n\n\nThey both knew the food items you bought regularly, the bath soap you liked to buy, or the candy your kids loved. They also understood your budget and made recommendations accordingly. You ended up liking their suggestions quite often, right?\n\n\nThis is the kind of relationship businesses need with their customers.\n\n\nThrough customer insights, you can personalize the interactions you have with your

{"prompt":"How to Leverage E-commerce Analytics to Augment Sales ->","completion":" \n\nDue to the rapid evolution of digital transformation, businesses selling products online have seen a staggering amount of growth.\n\n\nThe drawback of this explosive growth is the rise of numerous competitors. E-commerce vendors and sellers must understand all the dimensions of e-commerce strategies to stay on top.\nIn e-commerce businesses, not only are your customers royalty, but they also have all the power you need to grow your business. The best way to do that is to leverage analytics to understand industry trends and customer data, thus boosting your sales and expanding your e-commerce business.\nWhat is E-commerce Analytics?\nE-commerce analytics is the process of compiling raw data and converting it into valuable insights that impact your online business allowing you to make data-driven decisions by understanding the shifts in customer behavior and trends.\n\n\nIt enables you to drive more online sales by extracting and processing crucial information across customers’ buying journeys, from discovery to conversion.\n\n\nWhy is E-commerce Analytics More Important Than Ever?\n\n\n\n\nResearch from Deloitte shows that 49% of respondents agreed that analytics enable them to make better decisions.\n\n\nTruly, Knowledge is Power!\n\n\nIn the midst of the era of digital transformation, the pandemic made us rethink our lifestyle choices. With lockdowns across the globe, online sales grew rapidly as customers changed their buying habits, a trend that will be around for a long time and is expected to keep growing.\n\n\nE-commerce sales in the US are set to surpass $1 trillion, making up 18% of total retail sales by 2024.\n\n\nBenefits of Analytics for E-commerce\nYou will reap several benefits from using e-commerce analytics for your online shop.\n\n\n\n\nOptimize Pricing\nEighty percent of people say that competitive pricing is the most important aspect of shopping online.\n\n\nE-commerce data analytics empowers you with actionable insights that help you visualize sales for each customer segment at a granular level. You can leverage this data to understand the best prices at the product level to optimize costs and earn maximum revenue.\n\n\nOptimize Inventory Performance\nUnderestimating consumer demand will lead to insufficient inventory and customer dissatisfaction. In contrast, overestimating demand will lead to overstock, creating unnecessary manufacturing and storage costs.\n\n\nE-commerce analytics gives you the bigger picture so you can analyze demand versus inventory and optimize your sell-through performance.\n\n\nCustomer Insights to Personalize Experiences\nRemember the time you visited the neighborhood’s friendly general store or when an assistant in your go-to shopping place helped you throughout your buying experience?\n\n\nThey both knew the food items you bought regularly, the bath soap you liked to buy, or the candy your kids loved. They also understood your budget and made recommendations accordingly. You ended up liking their suggestions quite often, right?\n\n\nThis is the kind of relationship businesses need with their customers.\n\n\nThrough customer insights, you can personalize the interactions you have with your

{"prompt":"Maximizing Profitability: Data for Price Increases on Amazon ->","completion":" \n\nAmazon Vendors can use Average Selling Price and Net Product Margin to advocate for price increases with their Vendor Manager by providing data that shows the financial performance of their products.\n\n\nAverage Selling Price (ASP) is the average price at which a product sells on Amazon. By tracking the ASP of their products, vendors can see if they are selling at a competitive price compared to similar products in the market. If the ASP is lower than the industry average, vendors can use this data to show that they need to increase their prices to remain competitive.\nNet Pure Product Margin (PPM) is the profit margin Amazon earned on a product after accounting for all costs associated with that product. By tracking PPM, vendors can see how much profit Amazon is earning on each product. If PPM is high, it can indicate that Amazon can tolerate a price increase and retain profitability.\n\n\nWhen advocating for a price increase, vendors should present data on both ASP and PPM to their Vendor Manager. By showing that the ASP is lower than the industry average and that PPM is high, vendors can make a compelling case for a price increase.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that vendors can also advocate for price increases by showing how they are providing value to Amazon and its customers through things such as innovation, better quality products, or exceptional customer service.\n\n\nWith Visual COGS, vendors can have a powerful tool that tracks both ASP and Net PPM, providing them with the data they need to successfully advocate for price increases. It is an all-in-one Amazon Vendor Central solution that provides charts, graphs, and other features to help vendors monitor the financial performance of their products, and make data-driven decisions about pricing. This can give vendors an edge in negotiations with their Vendor Manager, and help them to maintain profitability while providing the best prices to customers."}
{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com.

They help promoters target particular segments without the advertisement feeling intrusive.\n\n\nContactless Transactions: Digital is the New Norm\nRetailers and brands design in-store applications to ensure contactless transactions.

{"prompt":"Maximizing Profitability: Data for Price Increases on Amazon ->","completion":" \n\nAmazon Vendors can use Average Selling Price and Net Product Margin to advocate for price increases with their Vendor Manager by providing data that shows the financial performance of their products.\n\n\nAverage Selling Price (ASP) is the average price at which a product sells on Amazon. By tracking the ASP of their products, vendors can see if they are selling at a competitive price compared to similar products in the market. If the ASP is lower than the industry average, vendors can use this data to show that they need to increase their prices to remain competitive.\nNet Pure Product Margin (PPM) is the profit margin Amazon earned on a product after accounting for all costs associated with that product. By tracking PPM, vendors can see how much profit Amazon is earning on each product. If PPM is high, it can indicate that Amazon can tolerate a price increase and retain profitability.\n\n\nWhen advocating for a price increase, vendors should present data on both ASP and PPM to their Vendor Manager. By showing that the ASP is lower than the industry average and that PPM is high, vendors can make a compelling case for a price increase.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that vendors can also advocate for price increases by showing how they are providing value to Amazon and its customers through things such as innovation, better quality products, or exceptional customer service.\n\n\nWith Visual COGS, vendors can have a powerful tool that tracks both ASP and Net PPM, providing them with the data they need to successfully advocate for price increases.

This small box includes the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, allowing one lucky vendor to stand out amongst the rest. It also shows the product’s price, shipping cost, and seller information.\n\n\nMost sales on Amazon happen through the Buy Box. Therefore, to get your products in front of customers more often than competitor products, you’ll need to win Amazon’s Buy Box.\n\n\nThe Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box is the number one factor that affects sales and profitability. Since the vast majority of sales on Amazon come through the Buy Box, vendors need to understand everything about it, including its competitive nature.\n\n\nWhile shopping online, customers click on product listings to see if the product meets their needs. If their needs are met, they then tap on the “Add to Cart” button. Customer rarely investigates the Buy Box winner, or if they do, they usually look for faster shipping or better ratings. Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box. The most common answer will be to manage all the aspects to stay ahead of other sellers. It is a huge hassle for vendors to keep track of everything on their own.\n\n\nWhat if there was a platform that gives you a complete insight into the required data and maintains it for you?\n\n\nVisual COGS provides you with data analytics, visual reports, and comprehensive dashboards—essentially, we do the hard work for you.\n\n\nOur dashboards give you Buy Box insights such as daily changes, MAP violations, Buy Box winners, other sellers, and price history so you’ll never be caught off guard.

This includes sending additional units or breaking the ship window rules, as well as failing to confirm POs in a timely manner.\nPackaging chargeback: These consist of many nominal charges that might be applied when you fail to pack your products systematically.\nDirect fulfillment cancellation rate chargeback: These chargebacks happen when you don’t have the inventory to fill an order Amazon places. A high cancellation rate might also harm your performance metrics and result in suspension.\nReceiving issues: Shipments that enter Amazon's fulfillment centers with compliance violations, such as barcode errors or labels with missing information, will result in these chargebacks. Therefore, ensure each shipment reaches its destination safely with features like scannable barcodes and carton labels displaying all the necessary information.\n\n\nTips to avoid Amazon chargeback\nAs an Amazon vendor, you are subject to many chargebacks from time to time. However, you can prevent these chargebacks if you are attentive to details and avoid a few key problems.\nSend ASNs for every shipment a few hours before the package arrives at a fulfillment center.\nMake sure that all of your products are packaged optimally and have proper labeling.\nMonitor Amazon's guidelines to check for new updates so that you follow all the rules systematically.\nSubmit a routing request before sending shipments to Amazon Fulfillment Centers.\nImplement an EDI system to automate order processing, including ASNs and acknowledgments.\nUse innovative tools like VisualCOGS.com to track chargebacks and reversal details in order to eliminate these charges over time.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs an Amazon vendor, it is essential to know the types of chargebacks and how to combat them. Visual COGS is a platform that provides a detailed daily analysis of your chargebacks, so they never go unnoticed. VisualCOGS help you dispute and reduce chargebacks by providing insights into their cause and eventually preparing you to avoid them completely.\nWhen you are armed with the right information, you can refute unfair chargebacks and keep your business running smoothly."}

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com. For tips and tricks to improve the SEO of your e-commerce website, read this blog.\n\n\nProgram for Supplier Diversity\nCostco is committed to creating opportunities for eligible local minority-owned and women-owned suppliers in their business areas and its Costco Vendor program.\n\n\nCostco Roadshow\nCostco Roadshow is a regular event for the retail warehouse giant's members.

Here are a few points that are going to help you get there.\nTo avoid supply shortages, be prepared to manufacture bulk products. Costco may terminate your membership if you continue to disappoint in supply and face shortages in quantities of items.\nGive a decent description of your item no fewer than 100 words for online sales to attract online shoppers and impulse-buy shoppers.\nInvest in the items that are in high demand among your subscribers.\nAllow Costco's marketing expertise to promote your items.\nEnsure that the quality of any item does not suffer.

That is approximately 83% of the total revenue registered. This figure clearly shows the impact the Buy Box can have on the net revenue generated and how it can accelerate the performance of your business.\n\n\n(Source: https:\/\/youramzseller.com\/blog\/winning-amazon-buy-box-in-2021)\n\n\nThus, Amazon sellers need to understand the Buy Box. This blog will review every aspect of Amazon’s Buy Box and the criteria you need to win it.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n· What is Amazon’s Buy Box?\n· The Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n· Let’s Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n   o Inventory\n   o Performance\n   o Product state\n   o Product cost\n   o Dispatch time\n   o Reviews\n· Accelerate your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n   o Fulfillment\n   o Shipping Time\n   o Landed Price\n   o Availability of Stock\n   o Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n   o Valid Tracking Rate\n·   Visual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n· Conclusion\n\n\nWhat is Amazon’s Buy Box?\n\n\nWhen you shop for a product on Amazon, you’ll see a box on the right-hand side of the page. This small box includes the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, allowing one lucky vendor to stand out amongst the rest. It also shows the product’s price, shipping cost, and seller information.\n\n\nMost sales on Amazon happen through the Buy Box. Therefore, to get your products in front of customers more often than competitor products, you’ll need to win Amazon’s Buy Box.\n\n\nThe Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box is the number one factor that affects sales and profitability. Since the vast majority of sales on Amazon come through the Buy Box, vendors need to understand everything about it, including its competitive nature.\n\n\nWhile shopping online, customers click on product listings to see if the product meets their needs. If their needs are met, they then tap on the “Add to Cart” button. Customer rarely investigates the Buy Box winner, or if they do, they usually look for faster shipping or better ratings. Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy.

E-commerce vendors and sellers must understand all the dimensions of e-commerce strategies to stay on top.\nIn e-commerce businesses, not only are your customers royalty, but they also have all the power you need to grow your business. The best way to do that is to leverage analytics to understand industry trends and customer data, thus boosting your sales and expanding your e-commerce business.\nWhat is E-commerce Analytics?\nE-commerce analytics is the process of compiling raw data and converting it into valuable insights that impact your online business allowing you to make data-driven decisions by understanding the shifts in customer behavior and trends.\n\n\nIt enables you to drive more online sales by extracting and processing crucial information across customers’ buying journeys, from discovery to conversion.\n\n\nWhy is E-commerce Analytics More Important Than Ever?\n\n\n\n\nResearch from Deloitte shows that 49% of respondents agreed that analytics enable them to make better decisions.\n\n\nTruly, Knowledge is Power!\n\n\nIn the midst of the era of digital transformation, the pandemic made us rethink our lifestyle choices.

Understanding the data as a whole is the best way to do it. Many vital measures required for your business growth are available in Amazon Vendor Central reports.\nAmazon reports provide vendors with crucial information to highlight the most critical facets of their business. In addition, these reports provide a complete summary of your brand performance, the best selling products, and other relevant information.  \n\n\nImportance of Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nMaking significant changes to your Amazon operations requires a firm grasp of crucial data. Imagine, if you don’t have any data to draw upon, how will you determine what is adequate for your brand? Or even if you have access to data, it won’t be enough to make any difference to your business until you understand it correctly. So, here is where Amazon Vendor Central reports come into play.\n\n\nVendor Central reports provide insight into the brand performance, which is impossible to track anywhere else. These reports furnish invaluable data about what works for your brand on Amazon (and what doesn’t). You can maintain and track all your business reports to serve your customers and maximize sales.\n\n\nThree Notable Reports of Amazon Vendor Central\n\n\nVendor Central has various types of reports to monitor your brand performance. However, the below three essential reports can help you understand your brand’s position in depth.\nInventory Planning and Forecasting\nInventory reports are usually multi-faceted and lengthy, which makes them more essential to understand. They can help you prevent overstock, understock, and out-of-stock products that may harm your Amazon revenue and sales momentum.\nUpcoming customer demand is projected in the Inventory Planning and Forecasting report. As the season progresses, this is essential for avoiding stock issues. Therefore, this report can help you prevent a negative impact on sales caused by never-ending inventory challenges.\n\n\nYou have four types of forecasted values:\nMean Forecast: Displays Amazon’s most accurate projection based on consumer demand overall.\nP90 Forecast: This signifies that there is a 90% chance that Amazon will purchase the product up to the given demand level and a 10% possibility that they will buy more than that.\nP80 Forecast: This signifies that there is an 80% possibility that Amazon will purchase the level of demand indicated and a 20% chance that they will buy more than the demand level indicated.\nP70 Forecast: This signifies that 70% possibility of Amazon purchasing up to the amount of demand stated and a 30% chance that they will buy more than that level.\n\n\nSales  Diagnostics\nThe Sales Diagnostic report from Amazon Brand Analytics is the most comprehensive report. You can monitor how well your ASINs are selling. It displays information based on pertinent variables, including traffic, views, price information, and stock-out statistics. In addition, you can use its analytics to ascertain how to boost your sales and optimize performance.\nPurchase Orders\nVendors should keep track of purchase orders (POs) from Amazon, as it is one of the most crucial parts of their business. However, you must be mindful, if you don't confirm those purchase orders, you risk losing the orders, and since Amazon considers indicators like PO confirmation rates when evaluating vendors, you risk losing future revenue.\n\n\nChallenges With Amazon Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nAmazon Vendor Central reports could be a source of great frustration because some reports are either too complex to navigate or just don’t display the information well. Here are some of the challenges you may encounter.\nThe first challenge is understanding all of the different types of reports available. There are sales reports, inventory reports, performance reports, and more. It can be difficult to know which report you need to look at to get the information you need.\nAnother challenge is that some of the reports are not updated in real time. This can make it difficult to track your progress and see how your business is doing.\nFinally, some of the reports can be confusing or difficult to interpret. This can make it challenging to spot trends or identify areas that need improvement.\nDespite these challenges, it is important to review your Vendor Central reports regularly. Consider signing up for third-party software to analyze your brand reports. Doing so can help you track your progress, spot trends, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nVisual COGS Reports; The Best Way Forward\n\n\nAll Amazon Vendors know the challenges of tracking their brand's performance and organizing all the data that entails.

{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing. However, if Amazon is making a profit with a healthy Net PPM from your products, you may have a stronger position to negotiate price increases for Amazon.\n\n\nTips for maintaining healthy PPM\nTrack gains and losses across your product catalog and be ready to invest in products with low Net PPM numbers if you want to save them from being listed as CRAP.\nAs a vendor, you can always offer Amazon your products at lower prices to increase its profits on them.\nYou can also offer bulk buys to Amazon at discounted prices for products with low Net PPM and close to getting listed as CRAP.\nYou must use a reliable tool like Visual COGS to successfully manage the Net PPM records for all your products.\n\n\nHow can Visual COGS assist you in staying current on your Net PPM?\nVisual COGS is an excellent platform to get insights into how things like the average selling price impact Net PPM so you can successfully negotiate price increases. You can easily track the weekly, monthly, and yearly Net PPM for individual products or product groups.\nNet PPM is crucial, as it reflects Amazon's profitability over your product. Making drastic changes to improve this metric may not be necessary, but tracking Net PPM across your catalog with VisualCOGS.com can bring big changes when leveraged correctly."}

This small box includes the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, allowing one lucky vendor to stand out amongst the rest. It also shows the product’s price, shipping cost, and seller information.\n\n\nMost sales on Amazon happen through the Buy Box. Therefore, to get your products in front of customers more often than competitor products, you’ll need to win Amazon’s Buy Box.\n\n\nThe Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box is the number one factor that affects sales and profitability. Since the vast majority of sales on Amazon come through the Buy Box, vendors need to understand everything about it, including its competitive nature.\n\n\nWhile shopping online, customers click on product listings to see if the product meets their needs. If their needs are met, they then tap on the “Add to Cart” button. Customer rarely investigates the Buy Box winner, or if they do, they usually look for faster shipping or better ratings. Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box. The most common answer will be to manage all the aspects to stay ahead of other sellers. It is a huge hassle for vendors to keep track of everything on their own.\n\n\nWhat if there was a platform that gives you a complete insight into the required data and maintains it for you?\n\n\nVisual COGS provides you with data analytics, visual reports, and comprehensive dashboards—essentially, we do the hard work for you.\n\n\nOur dashboards give you Buy Box insights such as daily changes, MAP violations, Buy Box winners, other sellers, and price history so you’ll never be caught off guard.

{"prompt":"Are Amazon Chargebacks Eating Your Profits? ->","completion":" It is no surprise that Amazon has a plethora of policies in place for its vendors in order to retain strong economies of scale. Amazon will charge suppliers for practically anything they can, including packing issues and technical EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transmission mistakes.\n`\nAmazon chargebacks are the fees that Amazon charges for not complying with its requirements for packaging, fulfillment, shipping, etc. Failure to resolve these issues could cause Amazon to reject your product, return or discard it, or even stop future shipments to Amazon fulfillment centers.

A high cancellation rate might also harm your performance metrics and result in suspension.\nReceiving issues: Shipments that enter Amazon's fulfillment centers with compliance violations, such as barcode errors or labels with missing information, will result in these chargebacks. Therefore, ensure each shipment reaches its destination safely with features like scannable barcodes and carton labels displaying all the necessary information.\n\n\nTips to avoid Amazon chargeback\nAs an Amazon vendor, you are subject to many chargebacks from time to time. However, you can prevent these chargebacks if you are attentive to details and avoid a few key problems.\nSend ASNs for every shipment a few hours before the package arrives at a fulfillment center.\nMake sure that all of your products are packaged optimally and have proper labeling.\nMonitor Amazon's guidelines to check for new updates so that you follow all the rules systematically.\nSubmit a routing request before sending shipments to Amazon Fulfillment Centers.\nImplement an EDI system to automate order processing, including ASNs and acknowledgments.\nUse innovative tools like VisualCOGS.com to track chargebacks and reversal details in order to eliminate these charges over time.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs an Amazon vendor, it is essential to know the types of chargebacks and how to combat them.

{"prompt":"Maximizing Profitability: Data for Price Increases on Amazon ->","completion":" \n\nAmazon Vendors can use Average Selling Price and Net Product Margin to advocate for price increases with their Vendor Manager by providing data that shows the financial performance of their products.\n\n\nAverage Selling Price (ASP) is the average price at which a product sells on Amazon. By tracking the ASP of their products, vendors can see if they are selling at a competitive price compared to similar products in the market. If the ASP is lower than the industry average, vendors can use this data to show that they need to increase their prices to remain competitive.\nNet Pure Product Margin (PPM) is the profit margin Amazon earned on a product after accounting for all costs associated with that product. By tracking PPM, vendors can see how much profit Amazon is earning on each product. If PPM is high, it can indicate that Amazon can tolerate a price increase and retain profitability.\n\n\nWhen advocating for a price increase, vendors should present data on both ASP and PPM to their Vendor Manager. By showing that the ASP is lower than the industry average and that PPM is high, vendors can make a compelling case for a price increase.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that vendors can also advocate for price increases by showing how they are providing value to Amazon and its customers through things such as innovation, better quality products, or exceptional customer service.\n\n\nWith Visual COGS, vendors can have a powerful tool that tracks both ASP and Net PPM, providing them with the data they need to successfully advocate for price increases.

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com. For tips and tricks to improve the SEO of your e-commerce website, read this blog.\n\n\nProgram for Supplier Diversity\nCostco is committed to creating opportunities for eligible local minority-owned and women-owned suppliers in their business areas and its Costco Vendor program.\n\n\nCostco Roadshow\nCostco Roadshow is a regular event for the retail warehouse giant's members. It's a presentation of roadshow products and services by Costco Vendors to Members and Buyers.\nWhen it comes to being a Costco Vendor, keep the following three factors in mind:\nCostco expects its vendors to prohibit illegal child labor, forced labor, and physical abuse of workers.\nCostco expects its vendors to follow the country's applicable labor and environmental laws and regulations where the merchandise gets produced.\nCostco encourages its vendors to work toward \"Above and Beyond Goals,\" which are continuous improvements in employee working conditions and environmental protection.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Becoming a Costco Vendor?\n\n\nIn 2021, Costco sold around $192 billion worth of merchandise and brought $3.9 billion worth of sales from membership fees. \n\n\nSo, where does Costco make its money?\nPart of the money comes from subscriptions, which are reliable and reduce theft.\n\n\nFor comparison, below are some of their membership sales and pricing, as well as average sales per warehouse:\n$60 for a Costco Business Membership.\n$60 for a Costco Gold Star Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Business Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Gold Star Membership.\nSuccess Strategies for a Costco Vendor\nMaintaining your business partnership with Costco necessitates continued sales and adherence to the company's rules and conditions.

That is approximately 83% of the total revenue registered. This figure clearly shows the impact the Buy Box can have on the net revenue generated and how it can accelerate the performance of your business.\n\n\n(Source: https:\/\/youramzseller.com\/blog\/winning-amazon-buy-box-in-2021)\n\n\nThus, Amazon sellers need to understand the Buy Box. This blog will review every aspect of Amazon’s Buy Box and the criteria you need to win it.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n· What is Amazon’s Buy Box?\n· The Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n· Let’s Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n   o Inventory\n   o Performance\n   o Product state\n   o Product cost\n   o Dispatch time\n   o Reviews\n· Accelerate your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n   o Fulfillment\n   o Shipping Time\n   o Landed Price\n   o Availability of Stock\n   o Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n   o Valid Tracking Rate\n·   Visual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n· Conclusion\n\n\nWhat is Amazon’s Buy Box?\n\n\nWhen you shop for a product on Amazon, you’ll see a box on the right-hand side of the page. This small box includes the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, allowing one lucky vendor to stand out amongst the rest. It also shows the product’s price, shipping cost, and seller information.\n\n\nMost sales on Amazon happen through the Buy Box. Therefore, to get your products in front of customers more often than competitor products, you’ll need to win Amazon’s Buy Box.\n\n\nThe Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box is the number one factor that affects sales and profitability. Since the vast majority of sales on Amazon come through the Buy Box, vendors need to understand everything about it, including its competitive nature.\n\n\nWhile shopping online, customers click on product listings to see if the product meets their needs. If their needs are met, they then tap on the “Add to Cart” button. Customer rarely investigates the Buy Box winner, or if they do, they usually look for faster shipping or better ratings. Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box. The most common answer will be to manage all the aspects to stay ahead of other sellers. It is a huge hassle for vendors to keep track of everything on their own.\n\n\nWhat if there was a platform that gives you a complete insight into the required data and maintains it for you?\n\n\nVisual COGS provides you with data analytics, visual reports, and comprehensive dashboards—essentially, we do the hard work for you.\n\n\nOur dashboards give you Buy Box insights such as daily changes, MAP violations, Buy Box winners, other sellers, and price history so you’ll never be caught off guard.

It doesn’t matter how many you have. You need to get more!\n\n\nHere’s the list of actions you should take to get more reviews and boost sales.\n\n\n1-  Encourage Customers to Leave a Positive Review\n\n\n\n\nCustomers are willing to spend 31% more on a business with excellent reviews.\n\n\nIf you're selling a product on eBay or Amazon, positive feedback from your customers will boost your sales.\n\n\nTelling customers to leave feedback for you is one thing, but getting them actually to do it is another.\n\n\nYou should know Amazon will ban your account if they find violations of their review policy.\n\n\nSo, If you are a seller or vendor on Amazon, read their review policy first.\n\n\nIf you have your own e-commerce website, you don’t have to worry about anything.\n\n\nFeel free to encourage your customers to leave positive reviews.\n\n\nHere's how:\nPut up a friendly reminder on your ordering page. Don't just include it on your order confirmation page; have it on the page showing their order details as well.\nOffering discounts on product reviews is one of my favorite ways to encourage customer feedback.

                                                                                                                                                                                       cost you more than you make in return.\nLive up to what you have advertised. If customers think that you tricked them into buying something of low quality they will end up leaving bad reviews.\n2- Monetize Your Reviews\nMonetizing your reviews is all about tapping the potential of your loyal customers. It's a great way to get an edge without having to spend more on advertisements.\n\n\nIf you are selling through your own e-commerce website. You can use your positive reviews to convert more leads and improve your brand image.\n\n\nHere’s how:\nDisplay your best reviews on the front page of the website.\nReply to customer feedback and make them feel heard.\nGive a prompt response and solve the customer’s problem when they leave a bad review.\nBesides increasing conversion, it will also help you build a better customer relationship.\n\n\n3- Understand the Importance of Negative Reviews\n\n\n\n\nWhile no one enjoys seeing negative reviews, negative reviews are a great way to improve your services and improve customer satisfaction.\n\n\nConsider the following:\nNegative reviews tell you where you are not meeting customer expectations.\nNegative reviews on competitive products show areas you can highlight on your products.\nNegative reviews will tell you how to update your product page to eliminate misunderstandings that cause negative reviews and returns.\nThe best way to handle a negative review is to thank reviewers for their feedback.\n\n\nResearch by ReviewTrackers in 2018 showed that about 53% of customers expect a response to their negative reviews within a week, and about 63% never hear back, leaving them disappointed.\n\n\nLet them know that you appreciate their input and make sure that they understand that their feedback helped.\n\n\n4- Tap into the Power of Insights and Analytics\nOnce you have a well-established business with a fair amount of reviews for your products, you want to make sure you're analyzing them quickly and efficiently.\n\n\nYou may not be able to parse through every review.\nBut what you can do is:\nList out positive and negative reviews separately.\nCompare your product reviews on a year-over-year basis.\nCompare the frequency of words used on reviews to better understand your customers’ problems and expectations.\nIf you are thinking that collecting all this data over boring spreadsheets will give you a headache and eat all your precious time.\n\n\nYou are damn right, it will.\n\n\nBut we both know that it would not be wise to miss out on the actionable insights that data can provide.\n\n\nNeed help?\nEveryone has access to the raw data that Amazon and other e-commerce platforms provide. But the e-commerce firms that inject big data analytics (BDA) into their value chain, experience 5–6% higher productivity than their competitors.\n\n\nThese firms never rely on raw data; instead, they use visual insights and advanced data analytics to fuel their growth.\n\n\nMost e-commerce sellers and vendors make serious mistakes and leave out valuable business opportunities due to their dependence on confusing chunks of raw data.\n\n\nDon’t make the same mistakes and leave valuable opportunities hidden in the dark just because you have fallen in love with spreadsheets.\n\n\nAt Visual COGS we are here to do all the heavy lifting for you. We will help you visualize years of data, analyze reviews, and find opportunities you couldn’t see before.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track your day-to-day performance.

Once your site gets ranked, the sales increase automatically.\n\n\nHowever, most newly set-up online businesses pay little or no attention to SEO strategies.\n\n\nVarious studies indicate that search accounts for most traffic of websites. A study by Outbrain showed that organic search beat social media by more than 300%.\n\n\nNow that we have a brief idea about SEO, let's get to the strategies.\nListing the Most Effective E-commerce SEO Strategies\nHere are a few key aspects for the best SEO strategy for E-commerce sites.\n\n\nE-commerce Keyword Analysis and Research\n\n\n\n\nThe first step to SEO campaigns is keyword research and analysis.\n\n\nThis is the most important step for developing the SEO strategy since\n1.  It will influence and inform all the other SEO tasks.\n2.  You will get target keywords that make it easy to rank.\n3.  The conversion rate is high and the search volume is satisfactory.\n4.  It is the key to unveiling the buyer's intent.\n\n\nHOW TO CONDUCT A KEYWORD RESEARCH FOR E-COMMERCE?\nThere are 3 ways to do keyword research for discovering keyword difficulty, search volume, and buyer intent- Amazon, competitor research, and SEO tools.\nAmazon: Whenever a user intends to buy a product, they go and search it on Amazon. This makes it a great resource for high buyer intent keywords. Amazon search tools also help in this process and provide free searches each day. Suppose you are setting up a small business for personalized gift items. You can start typing the seed keyword and get the keyword ideas. You can save them in your notes or a spreadsheet.\nResearching your competitors’ keywords: You can also use Google’s search engine to find high-ranking websites and derive keyword ideas from them. However, make sure that you don’t use the exact keywords blindly.\nUsing SEO tools and checkers: You can also make use of the various SEO tools available for boosting your campaigns.\nE-Commerce Website Architecture\nAfter you know the information you need, the next important aspect is your website’s architecture.\n\n\nHere are a few rules for a good site structure:\nYour e-commerce website should be simple to use and navigate.\nAny page should not be more than three clicks away from the current page.\nHave good content on your homepage, link to all product categories, and featured products.\n\n\n\n\nWhile building your website, make sure that your website has good performance. If your site takes more time than usual to load and reload, your traffic will decline.\nOn-page Optimization for E-commerce sites\nOn-page optimization is a way of certifying that your keywords fall in the right places and Google knows what your site is about.\nThere are three On-page SEO strategies for E-commerce websites.\nOn-page SEO for category pages\nOn-page SEO for product pages\nOn-page SEO for blogs\nFor this particular aspect, you should make sure that you include the target keyword in the\nMeta Title\nAlt Tag\nURL\nPage Title\nPage Headers and Subheaders\nProduct Description\nTechnical Audits for E-commerce websites\nTechnical SEO is one of those things that’s important for ALL sites… but doubly so for e-commerce. That’s because e-commerce sites tend to have LOTS of pages. And all of those pages increase the changes that technical SEO issues will crop up.\n\n\nNot only that, but most e-commerce pages don’t have that many backlinks pointing to them. This means that technical SEO is often the “tiebreaker” on Google’s first page. For example, if you and your competitor are neck-and-neck, a technical SEO issue can be the difference between the 4th spot and a coveted #1 ranking.\n\n\nHere are other SEO tools you can use for e-commerce site audits:\nSEMrush\nDeepCrawl\nScreamingFrog\nSite Condor\nSignificance of Content Marketing\n\n\nThe right content marketing strategy can help you get loads of targeted traffic and sales. You can achieve this through the three-fold method discussed below.\n\n\nExplore Your Target Customers Online\nHanging out with your customers gives you incredible insight into their thoughts, dreams, fears, and desires. Because it’s not always possible to hang out with customers in real life, I recommend going to places where they tend to hang out online.\n\n\nFor example, if your target audience is pet lovers, then you’d like to visit places like Reddit’s dog lovers’ or cat owners' community.\n\n\nUnderstand the Words and Phrases Your Target Customers Use\nNow that you’ve found your target audience, watch out for terms and phrases that they use to describe their issues and concerns.\nThese phrases represent keywords that your audience uses when they’re NOT shopping for products. These make great keywords for you to create blog content around.\n\n\nCreate Content Around That Keyword\nNow it’s time to create an engaging piece of content that’s the most definitive, useful, and absolute best on Earth.\nWhen you publish engaging content consistently on your e-commerce website, you’ll notice that all of these links, social media shares, and growing traffic, assist your product and category pages to rank better.\nHow Visual COGS can Help you Grow\nIn the arena of cut-throat competition, it is difficult to catch the attention of your target customers.\n\n\nSEO is obviously one of the best strategies to gain the attention of your target audience and get recognized.

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4.

This small box includes the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, allowing one lucky vendor to stand out amongst the rest. It also shows the product’s price, shipping cost, and seller information.\n\n\nMost sales on Amazon happen through the Buy Box. Therefore, to get your products in front of customers more often than competitor products, you’ll need to win Amazon’s Buy Box.\n\n\nThe Significance of Amazon’s Buy Box to Grow Your Business\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box is the number one factor that affects sales and profitability. Since the vast majority of sales on Amazon come through the Buy Box, vendors need to understand everything about it, including its competitive nature.\n\n\nWhile shopping online, customers click on product listings to see if the product meets their needs. If their needs are met, they then tap on the “Add to Cart” button. Customer rarely investigates the Buy Box winner, or if they do, they usually look for faster shipping or better ratings. Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box. The most common answer will be to manage all the aspects to stay ahead of other sellers. It is a huge hassle for vendors to keep track of everything on their own.\n\n\nWhat if there was a platform that gives you a complete insight into the required data and maintains it for you?\n\n\nVisual COGS provides you with data analytics, visual reports, and comprehensive dashboards—essentially, we do the hard work for you.\n\n\nOur dashboards give you Buy Box insights such as daily changes, MAP violations, Buy Box winners, other sellers, and price history so you’ll never be caught off guard.

Imagine, if you don’t have any data to draw upon, how will you determine what is adequate for your brand? Or even if you have access to data, it won’t be enough to make any difference to your business until you understand it correctly.

However, the below three essential reports can help you understand your brand’s position in depth.\nInventory Planning and Forecasting\nInventory reports are usually multi-faceted and lengthy, which makes them more essential to understand. They can help you prevent overstock, understock, and out-of-stock products that may harm your Amazon revenue and sales momentum.\nUpcoming customer demand is projected in the Inventory Planning and Forecasting report. As the season progresses, this is essential for avoiding stock issues. Therefore, this report can help you prevent a negative impact on sales caused by never-ending inventory challenges.\n\n\nYou have four types of forecasted values:\nMean Forecast: Displays Amazon’s most accurate projection based on consumer demand overall.\nP90 Forecast: This signifies that there is a 90% chance that Amazon will purchase the product up to the given demand level and a 10% possibility that they will buy more than that.\nP80 Forecast: This signifies that there is an 80% possibility that Amazon will purchase the level of demand indicated and a 20% chance that they will buy more than the demand level indicated.\nP70 Forecast: This signifies that 70% possibility of Amazon purchasing up to the amount of demand stated and a 30% chance that they will buy more than that level.\n\n\nSales  Diagnostics\nThe Sales Diagnostic report from Amazon Brand Analytics is the most comprehensive report.

{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing. However, if Amazon is making a profit with a healthy Net PPM from your products, you may have a stronger position to negotiate price increases for Amazon.\n\n\nTips for maintaining healthy PPM\nTrack gains and losses across your product catalog and be ready to invest in products with low Net PPM numbers if you want to save them from being listed as CRAP.\nAs a vendor, you can always offer Amazon your products at lower prices to increase its profits on them.\nYou can also offer bulk buys to Amazon at discounted prices for products with low Net PPM and close to getting listed as CRAP.\nYou must use a reliable tool like Visual COGS to successfully manage the Net PPM records for all your products.\n\n\nHow can Visual COGS assist you in staying current on your Net PPM?\nVisual COGS is an excellent platform to get insights into how things like the average selling price impact Net PPM so you can successfully negotiate price increases. You can easily track the weekly, monthly, and yearly Net PPM for individual products or product groups.\nNet PPM is crucial, as it reflects Amazon's profitability over your product.

Therefore, when the customer places their order, it typically goes directly to the seller that holds the Buy Box, increasing the sales for that particular vendor.\n\n\nCreating the best shopping experience for customers has always been Amazon’s primary goal. Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box.

{"prompt":"Are Amazon Chargebacks Eating Your Profits? ->","completion":" It is no surprise that Amazon has a plethora of policies in place for its vendors in order to retain strong economies of scale. Amazon will charge suppliers for practically anything they can, including packing issues and technical EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transmission mistakes.\n`\nAmazon chargebacks are the fees that Amazon charges for not complying with its requirements for packaging, fulfillment, shipping, etc. Failure to resolve these issues could cause Amazon to reject your product, return or discard it, or even stop future shipments to Amazon fulfillment centers.

A high cancellation rate might also harm your performance metrics and result in suspension.\nReceiving issues: Shipments that enter Amazon's fulfillment centers with compliance violations, such as barcode errors or labels with missing information, will result in these chargebacks. Therefore, ensure each shipment reaches its destination safely with features like scannable barcodes and carton labels displaying all the necessary information.\n\n\nTips to avoid Amazon chargeback\nAs an Amazon vendor, you are subject to many chargebacks from time to time. However, you can prevent these chargebacks if you are attentive to details and avoid a few key problems.\nSend ASNs for every shipment a few hours before the package arrives at a fulfillment center.\nMake sure that all of your products are packaged optimally and have proper labeling.\nMonitor Amazon's guidelines to check for new updates so that you follow all the rules systematically.\nSubmit a routing request before sending shipments to Amazon Fulfillment Centers.\nImplement an EDI system to automate order processing, including ASNs and acknowledgments.\nUse innovative tools like VisualCOGS.com to track chargebacks and reversal details in order to eliminate these charges over time.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs an Amazon vendor, it is essential to know the types of chargebacks and how to combat them.

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com. For tips and tricks to improve the SEO of your e-commerce website, read this blog.\n\n\nProgram for Supplier Diversity\nCostco is committed to creating opportunities for eligible local minority-owned and women-owned suppliers in their business areas and its Costco Vendor program.\n\n\nCostco Roadshow\nCostco Roadshow is a regular event for the retail warehouse giant's members. It's a presentation of roadshow products and services by Costco Vendors to Members and Buyers.\nWhen it comes to being a Costco Vendor, keep the following three factors in mind:\nCostco expects its vendors to prohibit illegal child labor, forced labor, and physical abuse of workers.\nCostco expects its vendors to follow the country's applicable labor and environmental laws and regulations where the merchandise gets produced.\nCostco encourages its vendors to work toward \"Above and Beyond Goals,\" which are continuous improvements in employee working conditions and environmental protection.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Becoming a Costco Vendor?\n\n\nIn 2021, Costco sold around $192 billion worth of merchandise and brought $3.9 billion worth of sales from membership fees. \n\n\nSo, where does Costco make its money?\nPart of the money comes from subscriptions, which are reliable and reduce theft.\n\n\nFor comparison, below are some of their membership sales and pricing, as well as average sales per warehouse:\n$60 for a Costco Business Membership.\n$60 for a Costco Gold Star Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Business Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Gold Star Membership.\nSuccess Strategies for a Costco Vendor\nMaintaining your business partnership with Costco necessitates continued sales and adherence to the company's rules and conditions. Here are a few points that are going to help you get there.\nTo avoid supply shortages, be prepared to manufacture bulk products.

{"prompt":"Three Noteworthy Amazon Vendor Central Reports For Your Progressive Business ->","completion":" On Amazon, it is critical for vendors to maximize efficiency and comprehend their consumer bases. Understanding the data as a whole is the best way to do it. Many vital measures required for your business growth are available in Amazon Vendor Central reports.\nAmazon reports provide vendors with crucial information to highlight the most critical facets of their business. In addition, these reports provide a complete summary of your brand performance, the best selling products, and other relevant information.  \n\n\nImportance of Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nMaking significant changes to your Amazon operations requires a firm grasp of crucial data. Imagine, if you don’t have any data to draw upon, how will you determine what is adequate for your brand? Or even if you have access to data, it won’t be enough to make any difference to your business until you understand it correctly. So, here is where Amazon Vendor Central reports come into play.\n\n\nVendor Central reports provide insight into the brand performance, which is impossible to track anywhere else. These reports furnish invaluable data about what works for your brand on Amazon (and what doesn’t). You can maintain and track all your business reports to serve your customers and maximize sales.\n\n\nThree Notable Reports of Amazon Vendor Central\n\n\nVendor Central has various types of reports to monitor your brand performance. However, the below three essential reports can help you understand your brand’s position in depth.\nInventory Planning and Forecasting\nInventory reports are usually multi-faceted and lengthy, which makes them more essential to understand. They can help you prevent overstock, understock, and out-of-stock products that may harm your Amazon revenue and sales momentum.\nUpcoming customer demand is projected in the Inventory Planning and Forecasting report. As the season progresses, this is essential for avoiding stock issues. Therefore, this report can help you prevent a negative impact on sales caused by never-ending inventory challenges.\n\n\nYou have four types of forecasted values:\nMean Forecast: Displays Amazon’s most accurate projection based on consumer demand overall.\nP90 Forecast: This signifies that there is a 90% chance that Amazon will purchase the product up to the given demand level and a 10% possibility that they will buy more than that.\nP80 Forecast: This signifies that there is an 80% possibility that Amazon will purchase the level of demand indicated and a 20% chance that they will buy more than the demand level indicated.\nP70 Forecast: This signifies that 70% possibility of Amazon purchasing up to the amount of demand stated and a 30% chance that they will buy more than that level.\n\n\nSales  Diagnostics\nThe Sales Diagnostic report from Amazon Brand Analytics is the most comprehensive report. You can monitor how well your ASINs are selling. It displays information based on pertinent variables, including traffic, views, price information, and stock-out statistics. In addition, you can use its analytics to ascertain how to boost your sales and optimize performance.\nPurchase Orders\nVendors should keep track of purchase orders (POs) from Amazon, as it is one of the most crucial parts of their business. However, you must be mindful, if you don't confirm those purchase orders, you risk losing the orders, and since Amazon considers indicators like PO confirmation rates when evaluating vendors, you risk losing future revenue.\n\n\nChallenges With Amazon Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nAmazon Vendor Central reports could be a source of great frustration because some reports are either too complex to navigate or just don’t display the information well. Here are some of the challenges you may encounter.\nThe first challenge is understanding all of the different types of reports available. There are sales reports, inventory reports, performance reports, and more. It can be difficult to know which report you need to look at to get the information you need.\nAnother challenge is that some of the reports are not updated in real time. This can make it difficult to track your progress and see how your business is doing.\nFinally, some of the reports can be confusing or difficult to interpret. This can make it challenging to spot trends or identify areas that need improvement.\nDespite these challenges, it is important to review your Vendor Central reports regularly. Consider signing up for third-party software to analyze your brand reports. Doing so can help you track your progress, spot trends, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nVisual COGS Reports; The Best Way Forward\n\n\nAll Amazon Vendors know the challenges of tracking their brand's performance and organizing all the data that entails. It’s even more difficult to use that data to make informed decisions. In these situations, Visual COGS is your one stop destination.\nVisual COGS is the first step to revamping your strategy and growing your business on Amazon. It tracks top-selling products, stock levels, aging inventory, sell-through rate, anticipated demand, and more. You can even compare weekly, monthly, and yearly trends on visual graphs. One of the most useful features is to use the forecast analyzer to determine precisely how many units of each product to plan for.\nVisual COGS parses your purchase orders across multiple parameters within a consolidated dashboard. This lets you estimate the lost sales due to missed POs and track performance trends over time. Without a doubt, Visual COGS reports are a wise choice to simplify crucial data.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com.

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com.

Here are a few points that are going to help you get there.\nTo avoid supply shortages, be prepared to manufacture bulk products. Costco may terminate your membership if you continue to disappoint in supply and face shortages in quantities of items.\nGive a decent description of your item no fewer than 100 words for online sales to attract online shoppers and impulse-buy shoppers.\nInvest in the items that are in high demand among your subscribers.\nAllow Costco's marketing expertise to promote your items.\nEnsure that the quality of any item does not suffer.

It is the key to unveiling the buyer's intent.\n\n\nHOW TO CONDUCT A KEYWORD RESEARCH FOR E-COMMERCE?\nThere are 3 ways to do keyword research for discovering keyword difficulty, search volume, and buyer intent- Amazon, competitor research, and SEO tools.\nAmazon: Whenever a user intends to buy a product, they go and search it on Amazon. This makes it a great resource for high buyer intent keywords. Amazon search tools also help in this process and provide free searches each day. Suppose you are setting up a small business for personalized gift items. You can start typing the seed keyword and get the keyword ideas. You can save them in your notes or a spreadsheet.\nResearching your competitors’ keywords: You can also use Google’s search engine to find high-ranking websites and derive keyword ideas from them. However, make sure that you don’t use the exact keywords blindly.\nUsing SEO tools and checkers: You can also make use of the various SEO tools available for boosting your campaigns.\nE-Commerce Website Architecture\nAfter you know the information you need, the next important aspect is your website’s architecture.\n\n\nHere are a few rules for a good site structure:\nYour e-commerce website should be simple to use and navigate.\nAny page should not be more than three clicks away from the current page.\nHave good content on your homepage, link to all product categories, and featured products.\n\n\n\n\nWhile building your website, make sure that your website has good performance.

That’s because e-commerce sites tend to have LOTS of pages. And all of those pages increase the changes that technical SEO issues will crop up.\n\n\nNot only that, but most e-commerce pages don’t have that many backlinks pointing to them.

{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing. However, if Amazon is making a profit with a healthy Net PPM from your products, you may have a stronger position to negotiate price increases for Amazon.\n\n\nTips for maintaining healthy PPM\nTrack gains and losses across your product catalog and be ready to invest in products with low Net PPM numbers if you want to save them from being listed as CRAP.\nAs a vendor, you can always offer Amazon your products at lower prices to increase its profits on them.\nYou can also offer bulk buys to Amazon at discounted prices for products with low Net PPM and close to getting listed as CRAP.\nYou must use a reliable tool like Visual COGS to successfully manage the Net PPM records for all your products.\n\n\nHow can Visual COGS assist you in staying current on your Net PPM?\nVisual COGS is an excellent platform to get insights into how things like the average selling price impact Net PPM so you can successfully negotiate price increases. You can easily track the weekly, monthly, and yearly Net PPM for individual products or product groups.\nNet PPM is crucial, as it reflects Amazon's profitability over your product. Making drastic changes to improve this metric may not be necessary, but tracking Net PPM across your catalog with VisualCOGS.com can bring big changes when leveraged correctly."}

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Tips to Successfully Negotiate Amazon Price Increases ->","completion":" As an Amazon Vendor, you may occasionally need to request a price increase for your products. This could be due to various factors, such as increased costs for materials, shipping, or other expenses. However, getting your price increase requests approved by Amazon can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get your price increase requests approved by Amazon:\n\n\nProvide a clear and concise explanation for why you are requesting a price increase. Amazon wants to know that the price increase is justified, so make sure to provide detailed information about the reasons for the request.\n\n\nConsider offering value-added services or additional product features to justify the price increase. For example, if you are raising the price of a product, you could offer a longer warranty or additional accessories to make the product more appealing to customers.\n\n\nBe willing to negotiate with Amazon. If your initial price increase request is denied, try to work with Amazon to find a compromise that will satisfy both parties.\nMonitor the prices of similar products on Amazon and use this information to support your request. If the prices of similar products have also increased, this can help to justify your own price increase.\n\n\nGetting your price increase requests approved by Amazon requires a combination of clear communication, value-added services, and a willingness to negotiate.

{"prompt":"Maximizing Profitability: Data for Price Increases on Amazon ->","completion":" \n\nAmazon Vendors can use Average Selling Price and Net Product Margin to advocate for price increases with their Vendor Manager by providing data that shows the financial performance of their products.\n\n\nAverage Selling Price (ASP) is the average price at which a product sells on Amazon. By tracking the ASP of their products, vendors can see if they are selling at a competitive price compared to similar products in the market. If the ASP is lower than the industry average, vendors can use this data to show that they need to increase their prices to remain competitive.\nNet Pure Product Margin (PPM) is the profit margin Amazon earned on a product after accounting for all costs associated with that product. By tracking PPM, vendors can see how much profit Amazon is earning on each product. If PPM is high, it can indicate that Amazon can tolerate a price increase and retain profitability.\n\n\nWhen advocating for a price increase, vendors should present data on both ASP and PPM to their Vendor Manager. By showing that the ASP is lower than the industry average and that PPM is high, vendors can make a compelling case for a price increase.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that vendors can also advocate for price increases by showing how they are providing value to Amazon and its customers through things such as innovation, better quality products, or exceptional customer service.\n\n\nWith Visual COGS, vendors can have a powerful tool that tracks both ASP and Net PPM, providing them with the data they need to successfully advocate for price increases. It is an all-in-one Amazon Vendor Central solution that provides charts, graphs, and other features to help vendors monitor the financial performance of their products, and make data-driven decisions about pricing. This can give vendors an edge in negotiations with their Vendor Manager, and help them to maintain profitability while providing the best prices to customers."}

{"prompt":"Tips to Successfully Negotiate Amazon Price Increases ->","completion":" As an Amazon Vendor, you may occasionally need to request a price increase for your products. This could be due to various factors, such as increased costs for materials, shipping, or other expenses. However, getting your price increase requests approved by Amazon can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get your price increase requests approved by Amazon:\n\n\nProvide a clear and concise explanation for why you are requesting a price increase. Amazon wants to know that the price increase is justified, so make sure to provide detailed information about the reasons for the request.\n\n\nConsider offering value-added services or additional product features to justify the price increase. For example, if you are raising the price of a product, you could offer a longer warranty or additional accessories to make the product more appealing to customers.\n\n\nBe willing to negotiate with Amazon. If your initial price increase request is denied, try to work with Amazon to find a compromise that will satisfy both parties.\nMonitor the prices of similar products on Amazon and use this information to support your request. If the prices of similar products have also increased, this can help to justify your own price increase.\n\n\nGetting your price increase requests approved by Amazon requires a combination of clear communication, value-added services, and a willingness to negotiate. By following these tips and preparing with tools like Visual COGS, you can increase your chances of getting your requests approved and maintaining a successful business on Amazon.\n\n"}

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com. For tips and tricks to improve the SEO of your e-commerce website, read this blog.\n\n\nProgram for Supplier Diversity\nCostco is committed to creating opportunities for eligible local minority-owned and women-owned suppliers in their business areas and its Costco Vendor program.\n\n\nCostco Roadshow\nCostco Roadshow is a regular event for the retail warehouse giant's members. It's a presentation of roadshow products and services by Costco Vendors to Members and Buyers.\nWhen it comes to being a Costco Vendor, keep the following three factors in mind:\nCostco expects its vendors to prohibit illegal child labor, forced labor, and physical abuse of workers.\nCostco expects its vendors to follow the country's applicable labor and environmental laws and regulations where the merchandise gets produced.\nCostco encourages its vendors to work toward \"Above and Beyond Goals,\" which are continuous improvements in employee working conditions and environmental protection.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Becoming a Costco Vendor?\n\n\nIn 2021, Costco sold around $192 billion worth of merchandise and brought $3.9 billion worth of sales from membership fees. \n\n\nSo, where does Costco make its money?\nPart of the money comes from subscriptions, which are reliable and reduce theft.\n\n\nFor comparison, below are some of their membership sales and pricing, as well as average sales per warehouse:\n$60 for a Costco Business Membership.\n$60 for a Costco Gold Star Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Business Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Gold Star Membership.\nSuccess Strategies for a Costco Vendor\nMaintaining your business partnership with Costco necessitates continued sales and adherence to the company's rules and conditions. Here are a few points that are going to help you get there.\nTo avoid supply shortages, be prepared to manufacture bulk products. Costco may terminate your membership if you continue to disappoint in supply and face shortages in quantities of items.\nGive a decent description of your item no fewer than 100 words for online sales to attract online shoppers and impulse-buy shoppers.\nInvest in the items that are in high demand among your subscribers.\nAllow Costco's marketing expertise to promote your items.\nEnsure that the quality of any item does not suffer.

Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any business is essential. This is possible via healthy inventory management.\nInventory management is an important factor for an Amazon vendor to focus on. Maintaining a healthy inventory can minimize the risk of losing customers, help you avoid aging and wasted products, make it easier to monitor the existing stock and ensure timely delivery.\n\n\nAmazon Vendor Central Inventory\nAmazon is the world’s biggest and most popular online market, so it is important for vendors who sell products on Amazon to understand how the company manages its inventory.\nAmazon uses a sophisticated inventory management system that allows vendors to track their inventory levels in near real time.

{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing. However, if Amazon is making a profit with a healthy Net PPM from your products, you may have a stronger position to negotiate price increases for Amazon.\n\n\nTips for maintaining healthy PPM\nTrack gains and losses across your product catalog and be ready to invest in products with low Net PPM numbers if you want to save them from being listed as CRAP.\nAs a vendor, you can always offer Amazon your products at lower prices to increase its profits on them.\nYou can also offer bulk buys to Amazon at discounted prices for products with low Net PPM and close to getting listed as CRAP.\nYou must use a reliable tool like Visual COGS to successfully manage the Net PPM records for all your products.\n\n\nHow can Visual COGS assist you in staying current on your Net PPM?\nVisual COGS is an excellent platform to get insights into how things like the average selling price impact Net PPM so you can successfully negotiate price increases. You can easily track the weekly, monthly, and yearly Net PPM for individual products or product groups.\nNet PPM is crucial, as it reflects Amazon's profitability over your product. Making drastic changes to improve this metric may not be necessary, but tracking Net PPM across your catalog with VisualCOGS.com can bring big changes when leveraged correctly."}

This could be due to various factors, such as increased costs for materials, shipping, or other expenses. However, getting your price increase requests approved by Amazon can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get your price increase requests approved by Amazon:\n\n\nProvide a clear and concise explanation for why you are requesting a price increase. Amazon wants to know that the price increase is justified, so make sure to provide detailed information about the reasons for the request.\n\n\nConsider offering value-added services or additional product features to justify the price increase. For example, if you are raising the price of a product, you could offer a longer warranty or additional accessories to make the product more appealing to customers.\n\n\nBe willing to negotiate with Amazon. If your initial price increase request is denied, try to work with Amazon to find a compromise that will satisfy both parties.\nMonitor the prices of similar products on Amazon and use this information to support your request. If the prices of similar products have also increased, this can help to justify your own price increase.\n\n\nGetting your price increase requests approved by Amazon requires a combination of clear communication, value-added services, and a willingness to negotiate. By following these tips and preparing with tools like Visual COGS, you can increase your chances of getting your requests approved and maintaining a successful business on Amazon.\n\n"}

{"prompt":"Are Amazon Chargebacks Eating Your Profits? ->","completion":" It is no surprise that Amazon has a plethora of policies in place for its vendors in order to retain strong economies of scale. Amazon will charge suppliers for practically anything they can, including packing issues and technical EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transmission mistakes.\n`\nAmazon chargebacks are the fees that Amazon charges for not complying with its requirements for packaging, fulfillment, shipping, etc. Failure to resolve these issues could cause Amazon to reject your product, return or discard it, or even stop future shipments to Amazon fulfillment centers. Therefore, Amazon vendors need to know how these fees impact their accounts and how to avoid them.\n\n\nTypes of chargebacks on Amazon\nThere can be several chargeback issues, but here are a few of them.\nASN (Advance Shipment Notification) chargeback: Failure to complete an ASN without any mistakes before your products arrive at the  Amazon fulfillment center. This is to help Amazon successfully schedule and prioritize the transportation of your items to their warehouses.\nPO chargeback: The most common type of chargeback from Amazon. This includes sending additional units or breaking the ship window rules, as well as failing to confirm POs in a timely manner.\nPackaging chargeback: These consist of many nominal charges that might be applied when you fail to pack your products systematically.\nDirect fulfillment cancellation rate chargeback: These chargebacks happen when you don’t have the inventory to fill an order Amazon places. A high cancellation rate might also harm your performance metrics and result in suspension.\nReceiving issues: Shipments that enter Amazon's fulfillment centers with compliance violations, such as barcode errors or labels with missing information, will result in these chargebacks. Therefore, ensure each shipment reaches its destination safely with features like scannable barcodes and carton labels displaying all the necessary information.\n\n\nTips to avoid Amazon chargeback\nAs an Amazon vendor, you are subject to many chargebacks from time to time. However, you can prevent these chargebacks if you are attentive to details and avoid a few key problems.\nSend ASNs for every shipment a few hours before the package arrives at a fulfillment center.\nMake sure that all of your products are packaged optimally and have proper labeling.\nMonitor Amazon's guidelines to check for new updates so that you follow all the rules systematically.\nSubmit a routing request before sending shipments to Amazon Fulfillment Centers.\nImplement an EDI system to automate order processing, including ASNs and acknowledgments.\nUse innovative tools like VisualCOGS.com to track chargebacks and reversal details in order to eliminate these charges over time.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs an Amazon vendor, it is essential to know the types of chargebacks and how to combat them. Visual COGS is a platform that provides a detailed daily analysis of your chargebacks, so they never go unnoticed.

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}

{"prompt":"Six Omnichannel Trends for your Business in 2022 ->","completion":" You’re looking for the perfect dress to rock your prom night. Do you just buy the first dress you try on, go hopping from store to store trying on a plethora of dresses, or do you make an online purchase?\n\n\nMost customers explore multiple channels before making a final purchase. About 86% of shoppers regularly channel-hop across at least two channels. This is why successful brands adopt an omnichannel approach as one of their main strategies.\n\n\nIn a world where customers are the kings, omnichannel marketing has grown vital to implement a customer-centric mantra for your growing brand.\n\n\nWhat’s Omnichannel Marketing?\nOmnichannel marketing is the seamless integration of all online and offline touchpoints (physical stores and websites), branding, and messaging for an enhanced customer experience and a consistent brand experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of the omnichannel approach include buying online and picking up in-store or buying at the store and getting it delivered.\n\n\nAbout 87% of the retailers acknowledge the importance of omnichannel marketing strategy for their business. \n\n\nSo, How can you achieve this?\n\n\nThe goal is to ensure that each time your customers interact with your brand, across any channel, the message you’re trying to convey to them is consistent and relevant. Through omnichannel marketing, you can create:\nConsistent and engaging branding\nPersonalized messaging based on the customer’s interests\nDynamic content based on past interactions and the customer’s present buying stage.\n\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Omnichannel Marketing?\n\n\nEnhanced User Experience and Customer Satisfaction\nBusinesses using an omnichannel approach experience a 90% higher retention rate than businesses using single-channel campaigns.\n\n\nCustomers buy from brands they can trust. Omnichannel marketing enables brands to create a consistent user experience across multiple platforms. By providing a personalized user experience, the customer feels known and valued, which increases customer satisfaction, boosting loyalty and retention.\n\n\nCohesive Brand Identity\nAn omnichannel approach helps ensure consistency on cross-channel platforms. Not only does this help form a consistent and cohesive brand identity, but it also forms a strong brand recall. \n\n\nThis strengthened brand recall dramatically increases the probability of purchases across your customer base.\n\n\nMaximize Your ROI\nBy fostering brand loyalty, customer retention, strong brand recall, and enhanced customer satisfaction, you’ll be able to attract new customers through word-of-mouth marketing, good recommendations, and positive reviews. More customers mean more business, and therefore, more revenue.\n\n\nOmnichannel Trends to Watchout for in 2022\nMore people are shopping digitally than ever before. There are about 2.14 billion online shoppers, which account for almost 30% of the world’s population.\n\n\nTo keep up with the evolving marketplace and capture the attention of your customers, here are the six latest omnichannel trends to grow your business.\n\n\nBetter Personalization: The Key to Improved Customer Relationships\nAccording to a report by HubSpot, 79% of customers stated that personalized customer service is more significant than marketing.\n\n\nWhen your organization opts for an omnichannel marketing strategy, the most critical aspect is to put your customers' interests first. A personalized approach will gain you loyal customers and numerous referrals.\n\n\nMicrosoft revealed that 96% of customers say customer service is essential for loyalty to a particular brand. You can provide a personal touch by training your customer-facing team about the importance of personalized communication. Your customers will expect you to know:\nTheir name and location\nPast conversations\nTheir previous purchases\nA unified and personalized experience will not only favor trust and loyalty but will gain you positive reviews and referrals. For example, the Customer Expectations Report of 2020 released by HubSpot revealed that 77% of your satisfied customers would refer others to your organization.\n\n\nAR Applications: Adding the ‘Element of Touch’\nOne of the best ways to give a personal touch is Augmented Reality (AR). It will help customers connect with your products, allowing them to imagine how these products will fit into their lives.\n\n\nSeveral brands like Shopify, Target, IKEA and The Home Depot have embedded AR in their customers' shopping experience. Here are some examples of how marketers apply AR technology.\nThey help you try on spectacles, sunglasses, apparel, and accessories to see if they suit you.\nFilters from social media let you test hair dye to see how you’ll look with a new color.\nApps give you a preview of how a particular piece of furniture, like a table or sofa, will fit into your living space.\nBrick-and-Mortar Space: Making a Comeback\nPhysical stores are here to stay. Many people still prefer in-person shopping. This provides an opportunity to establish your presence in local communities while adding another sales channel into the mix.\n\n\nAbout 89% of women and 78% of men who visit offline stores stated that they add extra items while they shop beyond their specified requirement. This shows that the trend of impulse buying is active and customers are more likely to add to their shopping cart once inside an offline shop.\n\n\nAround 59% of customers state that they’re likely to look at a product online and buy in-store. So, by blending the offline and online customer experiences, brands can provide an ultimate omnichannel experience.\n\n\nVideo Content and Shoppable Videos: Engage Customers Dynamically\n\n\nShoppable videos and other video content are crucial omnichannel marketing trends to watch for in 2022.\n\n\nCisco states that videos will constitute 82% of all online traffic by 2022. Consumers are around 85% more likely to buy a product after watching a video about it.\n\n\nThe above data indicates that selling through video content is to become a significant trend.\nYou may be aware of the digital trend allowing Instagram users to tap on posts to purchase products simply. Shoppable videos work the same way. They help promoters target particular segments without the advertisement feeling intrusive.\n\n\nContactless Transactions: Digital is the New Norm\nRetailers and brands design in-store applications to ensure contactless transactions. An in-store application provides a virtual shopping experience to its customers by encapsulating all essential functions in a suitable way.\n\n\nConsumers with many touchpoints will expect more options at each stage, from pickup options, delivery, and logistics to the point of purchases and social distancing protocols.\n\n\nApply Customer Data Offline: Nailing your Data-Driven Strategies\nA report by Harvard Business Review showed that 73% of the customers use multiple channels in their shopping journey.\n\n\nThe direct-to-customer brand always has the advantage of leveraging data to improve customer relationships. Applying leveraged customer data to other channels will create effective promotions, more conversions, improved product development information, and strengthen consumer relationships.\n\n\nResearch has shown nine out of 10 customers prefer the omnichannel experience.\nThe pandemic has brought significant changes in shopping behaviors and trends, which are likely to continue even after the threat of contagion is over. Providing a seamless and unified customer experience through omnichannel marketing is essential.\n\n\nTake Your Business to The Next Level\nTo leverage omnichannel marketing, the most crucial aspect is data collection and analytics, but without a team and the necessary infrastructure to translate data into actionable insights, it is all useless.\n\n\nVisual COGS is the ultimate analytics platform built to uncover valuable insights for e-commerce brands. By deploying an analytics platform, like Visual COGS, you can distill data in real-time, allowing your business to quickly course correct while running omnichannel campaigns and meeting your customers' needs.\n\n\nClick on this link to request a demo now!"}

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}

{"prompt":"Three Noteworthy Amazon Vendor Central Reports For Your Progressive Business ->","completion":" On Amazon, it is critical for vendors to maximize efficiency and comprehend their consumer bases. Understanding the data as a whole is the best way to do it. Many vital measures required for your business growth are available in Amazon Vendor Central reports.\nAmazon reports provide vendors with crucial information to highlight the most critical facets of their business. In addition, these reports provide a complete summary of your brand performance, the best selling products, and other relevant information.  \n\n\nImportance of Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nMaking significant changes to your Amazon operations requires a firm grasp of crucial data. Imagine, if you don’t have any data to draw upon, how will you determine what is adequate for your brand? Or even if you have access to data, it won’t be enough to make any difference to your business until you understand it correctly. So, here is where Amazon Vendor Central reports come into play.\n\n\nVendor Central reports provide insight into the brand performance, which is impossible to track anywhere else. These reports furnish invaluable data about what works for your brand on Amazon (and what doesn’t). You can maintain and track all your business reports to serve your customers and maximize sales.\n\n\nThree Notable Reports of Amazon Vendor Central\n\n\nVendor Central has various types of reports to monitor your brand performance. However, the below three essential reports can help you understand your brand’s position in depth.\nInventory Planning and Forecasting\nInventory reports are usually multi-faceted and lengthy, which makes them more essential to understand. They can help you prevent overstock, understock, and out-of-stock products that may harm your Amazon revenue and sales momentum.\nUpcoming customer demand is projected in the Inventory Planning and Forecasting report. As the season progresses, this is essential for avoiding stock issues. Therefore, this report can help you prevent a negative impact on sales caused by never-ending inventory challenges.\n\n\nYou have four types of forecasted values:\nMean Forecast: Displays Amazon’s most accurate projection based on consumer demand overall.\nP90 Forecast: This signifies that there is a 90% chance that Amazon will purchase the product up to the given demand level and a 10% possibility that they will buy more than that.\nP80 Forecast: This signifies that there is an 80% possibility that Amazon will purchase the level of demand indicated and a 20% chance that they will buy more than the demand level indicated.\nP70 Forecast: This signifies that 70% possibility of Amazon purchasing up to the amount of demand stated and a 30% chance that they will buy more than that level.\n\n\nSales  Diagnostics\nThe Sales Diagnostic report from Amazon Brand Analytics is the most comprehensive report. You can monitor how well your ASINs are selling. It displays information based on pertinent variables, including traffic, views, price information, and stock-out statistics. In addition, you can use its analytics to ascertain how to boost your sales and optimize performance.\nPurchase Orders\nVendors should keep track of purchase orders (POs) from Amazon, as it is one of the most crucial parts of their business. However, you must be mindful, if you don't confirm those purchase orders, you risk losing the orders, and since Amazon considers indicators like PO confirmation rates when evaluating vendors, you risk losing future revenue.\n\n\nChallenges With Amazon Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nAmazon Vendor Central reports could be a source of great frustration because some reports are either too complex to navigate or just don’t display the information well. Here are some of the challenges you may encounter.\nThe first challenge is understanding all of the different types of reports available. There are sales reports, inventory reports, performance reports, and more. It can be difficult to know which report you need to look at to get the information you need.\nAnother challenge is that some of the reports are not updated in real time. This can make it difficult to track your progress and see how your business is doing.\nFinally, some of the reports can be confusing or difficult to interpret. This can make it challenging to spot trends or identify areas that need improvement.\nDespite these challenges, it is important to review your Vendor Central reports regularly. Consider signing up for third-party software to analyze your brand reports. Doing so can help you track your progress, spot trends, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nVisual COGS Reports; The Best Way Forward\n\n\nAll Amazon Vendors know the challenges of tracking their brand's performance and organizing all the data that entails.

{"prompt":"Sourcing vs. Manufacturing Distributor Views; It's Important ->","completion":" Amazon Vendor Central allows vendors to access sales metrics across their catalog. Sales from Amazon to their customers can be found in the Sales Diagnostics report as Shipped COGS. When viewing these reports it’s important to understand which Distributor View you have selected, specifically, the difference between the Sourcing and Manufacturing views.\n\n\nWhen Amazon sells your product, it sources from either your inventory or another seller.

With the increasing emphasis on automation and AI, vendors will need to stay ahead of the curve to remain competitive.\n\n\nOne of the significant changes vendors can expect to see is an increasing emphasis on automation and AI. Having access to tools and features that automate repetitive tasks, analyze sales data and customer behavior, and predict future trends can save vendors time and effort while allowing them to stay ahead of the competition.\nAnother area to watch is Amazon's Private Label program. Analyzing sales data and customer behavior and predicting future trends can help vendors identify new opportunities and implement effective strategies to remain competitive.\n\n\nAmazon is also placing an increasing emphasis on sustainability. Having access to tools and features that track vendors' carbon footprint and monitor their environmental impact, can allow vendors to take part in initiatives aimed at reducing waste and promoting environmentally friendly practices.\nIn addition, Amazon will continue to focus on providing excellent customer service. Monitoring customer feedback and responding to it in a timely and effective manner is essential to maintain a good reputation as a trusted vendor.\n\n\nLastly, with Amazon's global expansion, vendors can expect to see more opportunities to sell their products to customers worldwide. Having access to tools and features that make it easier for vendors to sell in different countries, such as new marketplaces, logistics solutions, and localization features, can help vendors expand their business globally.\n\n\nThe future of Amazon Vendor Central is expected to bring many changes and opportunities for vendors.

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box.

This could be due to various factors, such as increased costs for materials, shipping, or other expenses. However, getting your price increase requests approved by Amazon can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get your price increase requests approved by Amazon:\n\n\nProvide a clear and concise explanation for why you are requesting a price increase. Amazon wants to know that the price increase is justified, so make sure to provide detailed information about the reasons for the request.\n\n\nConsider offering value-added services or additional product features to justify the price increase. For example, if you are raising the price of a product, you could offer a longer warranty or additional accessories to make the product more appealing to customers.\n\n\nBe willing to negotiate with Amazon. If your initial price increase request is denied, try to work with Amazon to find a compromise that will satisfy both parties.\nMonitor the prices of similar products on Amazon and use this information to support your request. If the prices of similar products have also increased, this can help to justify your own price increase.\n\n\nGetting your price increase requests approved by Amazon requires a combination of clear communication, value-added services, and a willingness to negotiate.

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program.

{"prompt":"Tips to Successfully Negotiate Amazon Price Increases ->","completion":" As an Amazon Vendor, you may occasionally need to request a price increase for your products. This could be due to various factors, such as increased costs for materials, shipping, or other expenses. However, getting your price increase requests approved by Amazon can sometimes be challenging.\n\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get your price increase requests approved by Amazon:\n\n\nProvide a clear and concise explanation for why you are requesting a price increase. Amazon wants to know that the price increase is justified, so make sure to provide detailed information about the reasons for the request.\n\n\nConsider offering value-added services or additional product features to justify the price increase. For example, if you are raising the price of a product, you could offer a longer warranty or additional accessories to make the product more appealing to customers.\n\n\nBe willing to negotiate with Amazon. If your initial price increase request is denied, try to work with Amazon to find a compromise that will satisfy both parties.\nMonitor the prices of similar products on Amazon and use this information to support your request. If the prices of similar products have also increased, this can help to justify your own price increase.\n\n\nGetting your price increase requests approved by Amazon requires a combination of clear communication, value-added services, and a willingness to negotiate. By following these tips and preparing with tools like Visual COGS, you can increase your chances of getting your requests approved and maintaining a successful business on Amazon.\n\n"}

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com. For tips and tricks to improve the SEO of your e-commerce website, read this blog.\n\n\nProgram for Supplier Diversity\nCostco is committed to creating opportunities for eligible local minority-owned and women-owned suppliers in their business areas and its Costco Vendor program.\n\n\nCostco Roadshow\nCostco Roadshow is a regular event for the retail warehouse giant's members. It's a presentation of roadshow products and services by Costco Vendors to Members and Buyers.\nWhen it comes to being a Costco Vendor, keep the following three factors in mind:\nCostco expects its vendors to prohibit illegal child labor, forced labor, and physical abuse of workers.\nCostco expects its vendors to follow the country's applicable labor and environmental laws and regulations where the merchandise gets produced.\nCostco encourages its vendors to work toward \"Above and Beyond Goals,\" which are continuous improvements in employee working conditions and environmental protection.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Becoming a Costco Vendor?\n\n\nIn 2021, Costco sold around $192 billion worth of merchandise and brought $3.9 billion worth of sales from membership fees. \n\n\nSo, where does Costco make its money?\nPart of the money comes from subscriptions, which are reliable and reduce theft.\n\n\nFor comparison, below are some of their membership sales and pricing, as well as average sales per warehouse:\n$60 for a Costco Business Membership.\n$60 for a Costco Gold Star Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Business Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Gold Star Membership.\nSuccess Strategies for a Costco Vendor\nMaintaining your business partnership with Costco necessitates continued sales and adherence to the company's rules and conditions. Here are a few points that are going to help you get there.\nTo avoid supply shortages, be prepared to manufacture bulk products. Costco may terminate your membership if you continue to disappoint in supply and face shortages in quantities of items.\nGive a decent description of your item no fewer than 100 words for online sales to attract online shoppers and impulse-buy shoppers.\nInvest in the items that are in high demand among your subscribers.\nAllow Costco's marketing expertise to promote your items.\nEnsure that the quality of any item does not suffer. This may result in the termination of your business relationship.\nSkyrocket Your Growth in Costco with Visual COGS\nJust started out as a Costco vendor?\n\n\nWe bring you Visual COGS, an e-commerce data analytics tool designed for sellers on Costco.com to surface actionable insights.

{"prompt":"Simplify Your Inventory Management with Visual COGS ->","completion":" High storage costs, dead stock, damaged products, or worse, unavailable inventory; the repercussions of poor inventory are not visible for weeks or months, but when it becomes apparent, it can cause huge damage to your brand. Maintaining up-to-date inventory is a kind of investment for your business; the more carefully you look after it, the more profit you will earn.\n\n\nUndoubtedly, the international marketplace can lead to significant sales opportunities for your brand and generate considerable profits for your business. But as your business grows, the demand for your products increases, making it hard to anticipate the fluctuations in customer demand. Therefore, it is vital to have a plan for your inventory and keep monitoring its health accordingly. So here arises a question: how do you do it?\n\n\nWell, in this blog, you are going to learn about inventory planning, pick up a few tips on healthy inventory maintenance and understand the importance of data analytics tools like Visual COGS that monitor your inventory. Interesting, right? So, let’s get into it.\n\n\nImportance of Inventory Management\nInventory management entails the process of tracking and storing products. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any business is essential. This is possible via healthy inventory management.\nInventory management is an important factor for an Amazon vendor to focus on. Maintaining a healthy inventory can minimize the risk of losing customers, help you avoid aging and wasted products, make it easier to monitor the existing stock and ensure timely delivery.\n\n\nAmazon Vendor Central Inventory\nAmazon is the world’s biggest and most popular online market, so it is important for vendors who sell products on Amazon to understand how the company manages its inventory.\nAmazon uses a sophisticated inventory management system that allows vendors to track their inventory levels in near real time. This system helps Amazon to keep track of the available products, their quantities, and the location of all their products. In addition, it monitors the stock levels and ensures that Amazon always has sufficient inventory for order fulfillment and customer satisfaction.\nAmazon’s inventory management system is just one example of how important inventory management can be for businesses. Any business that sells online or offline products must have an excellent inventory management system.\n\n\nTips To Manage Healthy Inventory\nPrioritize your inventory\nIt is crucial to review your product and sales statistics to determine which products are selling well and which aren't. This process will assist you in deciding which products to retain on hand and which to sell. VisualCOGS.com is a smart way to do this.\nKeep fast-selling products in stock\nDon’t let stockouts occur. This is important because, if a customer wants to buy your product, but you don’t have enough stock to fulfill their demand, they may go to your competitor and develop brand loyalty elsewhere. Instead, use VisualCOGS.com to predict customer demand and never stock out again.\nAvoid overstock\nOverstock can tie up valuable capital that could be utilized elsewhere. It can lead to high storage costs and quality issues. Thus, use VisualCOGS.com to keep track of the latest market trends and reorder products in step with customer demand.\nUse automated tools\nThere are many tools available that can help you manage your inventory efficiently. These tools can automate tasks like ordering and reordering products and tracking inventory. Here, VisualCOGS.com is an intelligent choice to effortlessly monitor your inventory.\nMonitor sell-through rate\nHow well you balance your inventory levels is determined by your sell-through rate. A healthy balance between incoming and outgoing units is a crucial factor to check, and VisualCOGS.com can easily do it for you. It examines past orders and utilizes advanced sales forecasting methods to anticipate demand.\n\n\nWhy Visual COGS?\nManual documentation, limited visibility, stock issues, supply chain complexity, and inconsistent data are just some of the significant problems vendors face while managing their Amazon inventory. Third-party software can be a great option, especially if you have an extensive catalog. There are many programs available, so take some time to find the best fit for your business. Make sure the software is compatible with Amazon Vendor Central data before making your purchase. Visual COGS is likely the best choice.\nVisual COGS is a fantastic platform that provides a unified dashboard of your inventory metrics. It lets you track stock levels of top-selling products, aging inventory, sell-through rate, forecasted demand, and much more. In addition, you can easily track weekly and monthly trends on intuitive charts and graphs.

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}

{"prompt":"Are Amazon Chargebacks Eating Your Profits? ->","completion":" It is no surprise that Amazon has a plethora of policies in place for its vendors in order to retain strong economies of scale. Amazon will charge suppliers for practically anything they can, including packing issues and technical EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transmission mistakes.\n`\nAmazon chargebacks are the fees that Amazon charges for not complying with its requirements for packaging, fulfillment, shipping, etc. Failure to resolve these issues could cause Amazon to reject your product, return or discard it, or even stop future shipments to Amazon fulfillment centers. Therefore, Amazon vendors need to know how these fees impact their accounts and how to avoid them.\n\n\nTypes of chargebacks on Amazon\nThere can be several chargeback issues, but here are a few of them.\nASN (Advance Shipment Notification) chargeback: Failure to complete an ASN without any mistakes before your products arrive at the  Amazon fulfillment center. This is to help Amazon successfully schedule and prioritize the transportation of your items to their warehouses.\nPO chargeback: The most common type of chargeback from Amazon. This includes sending additional units or breaking the ship window rules, as well as failing to confirm POs in a timely manner.\nPackaging chargeback: These consist of many nominal charges that might be applied when you fail to pack your products systematically.\nDirect fulfillment cancellation rate chargeback: These chargebacks happen when you don’t have the inventory to fill an order Amazon places. A high cancellation rate might also harm your performance metrics and result in suspension.\nReceiving issues: Shipments that enter Amazon's fulfillment centers with compliance violations, such as barcode errors or labels with missing information, will result in these chargebacks. Therefore, ensure each shipment reaches its destination safely with features like scannable barcodes and carton labels displaying all the necessary information.\n\n\nTips to avoid Amazon chargeback\nAs an Amazon vendor, you are subject to many chargebacks from time to time. However, you can prevent these chargebacks if you are attentive to details and avoid a few key problems.\nSend ASNs for every shipment a few hours before the package arrives at a fulfillment center.\nMake sure that all of your products are packaged optimally and have proper labeling.\nMonitor Amazon's guidelines to check for new updates so that you follow all the rules systematically.\nSubmit a routing request before sending shipments to Amazon Fulfillment Centers.\nImplement an EDI system to automate order processing, including ASNs and acknowledgments.\nUse innovative tools like VisualCOGS.com to track chargebacks and reversal details in order to eliminate these charges over time.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs an Amazon vendor, it is essential to know the types of chargebacks and how to combat them. Visual COGS is a platform that provides a detailed daily analysis of your chargebacks, so they never go unnoticed. VisualCOGS help you dispute and reduce chargebacks by providing insights into their cause and eventually preparing you to avoid them completely.\nWhen you are armed with the right information, you can refute unfair chargebacks and keep your business running smoothly."}
{"prompt":"Maximizing Profitability: Data for Price Increases on Amazon ->","completion":" \n\nAmazon Vendors can use Average Selling Price and Net Product Margin to advocate for price increases with their Vendor Manager by providing data that shows the financial performance of their products.\n\n\nAverage Selling Price (ASP) is the average price at which a product sells on Amazon. By tracking the ASP of their products, vendors can see if they are selling at a competitive price compared to similar products in the market. If the ASP is lower than the industry average, vendors can use this data to show that they need to increase their prices to remain competitive.\nNet Pure Product Margin (PPM) is the profit margin Amazon earned on a product after accounting for all costs associated with that product. By tracking PPM, vendors can see how much profit Amazon is earning on each product. If PPM is high, it can indicate that Amazon can tolerate a price increase and retain profitability.\n\n\nWhen advocating for a price increase, vendors should present data on both ASP and PPM to their Vendor Manager. By showing that the ASP is lower than the industry average and that PPM is high, vendors can make a compelling case for a price increase.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that vendors can also advocate for price increases by showing how they are providing value to Amazon and its customers through things such as innovation, better quality products, or exceptional customer service.\n\n\nWith Visual COGS, vendors can have a powerful tool that tracks both ASP and Net PPM, providing them with the data they need to successfully advocate for price increases. It is an all-in-one Amazon Vendor Central solution that provides charts, graphs, and other features to help vendors monitor the financial performance of their products, and make data-driven decisions about pricing. This can give vendors an edge in negotiations with their Vendor Manager, and help them to maintain profitability while providing the best prices to customers."}
{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com. For tips and tricks to improve the SEO of your e-commerce website, read this blog.\n\n\nProgram for Supplier Diversity\nCostco is committed to creating opportunities for eligible local minority-owned and women-owned suppliers in their business areas and its Costco Vendor program.\n\n\nCostco Roadshow\nCostco Roadshow is a regular event for the retail warehouse giant's members. It's a presentation of roadshow products and services by Costco Vendors to Members and Buyers.\nWhen it comes to being a Costco Vendor, keep the following three factors in mind:\nCostco expects its vendors to prohibit illegal child labor, forced labor, and physical abuse of workers.\nCostco expects its vendors to follow the country's applicable labor and environmental laws and regulations where the merchandise gets produced.\nCostco encourages its vendors to work toward \"Above and Beyond Goals,\" which are continuous improvements in employee working conditions and environmental protection.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Becoming a Costco Vendor?\n\n\nIn 2021, Costco sold around $192 billion worth of merchandise and brought $3.9 billion worth of sales from membership fees. \n\n\nSo, where does Costco make its money?\nPart of the money comes from subscriptions, which are reliable and reduce theft.\n\n\nFor comparison, below are some of their membership sales and pricing, as well as average sales per warehouse:\n$60 for a Costco Business Membership.\n$60 for a Costco Gold Star Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Business Membership.\n$120 for a Costco Executive Gold Star Membership.\nSuccess Strategies for a Costco Vendor\nMaintaining your business partnership with Costco necessitates continued sales and adherence to the company's rules and conditions. Here are a few points that are going to help you get there.\nTo avoid supply shortages, be prepared to manufacture bulk products. Costco may terminate your membership if you continue to disappoint in supply and face shortages in quantities of items.\nGive a decent description of your item no fewer than 100 words for online sales to attract online shoppers and impulse-buy shoppers.\nInvest in the items that are in high demand among your subscribers.\nAllow Costco's marketing expertise to promote your items.\nEnsure that the quality of any item does not suffer.

They can help you prevent overstock, understock, and out-of-stock products that may harm your Amazon revenue and sales momentum.\nUpcoming customer demand is projected in the Inventory Planning and Forecasting report. As the season progresses, this is essential for avoiding stock issues. Therefore, this report can help you prevent a negative impact on sales caused by never-ending inventory challenges.\n\n\nYou have four types of forecasted values:\nMean Forecast: Displays Amazon’s most accurate projection based on consumer demand overall.\nP90 Forecast: This signifies that there is a 90% chance that Amazon will purchase the product up to the given demand level and a 10% possibility that they will buy more than that.\nP80 Forecast: This signifies that there is an 80% possibility that Amazon will purchase the level of demand indicated and a 20% chance that they will buy more than the demand level indicated.\nP70 Forecast: This signifies that 70% possibility of Amazon purchasing up to the amount of demand stated and a 30% chance that they will buy more than that level.\n\n\nSales  Diagnostics\nThe Sales Diagnostic report from Amazon Brand Analytics is the most comprehensive report. You can monitor how well your ASINs are selling. It displays information based on pertinent variables, including traffic, views, price information, and stock-out statistics. In addition, you can use its analytics to ascertain how to boost your sales and optimize performance.\nPurchase Orders\nVendors should keep track of purchase orders (POs) from Amazon, as it is one of the most crucial parts of their business. However, you must be mindful, if you don't confirm those purchase orders, you risk losing the orders, and since Amazon considers indicators like PO confirmation rates when evaluating vendors, you risk losing future revenue.\n\n\nChallenges With Amazon Vendor Central Reports\n\n\nAmazon Vendor Central reports could be a source of great frustration because some reports are either too complex to navigate or just don’t display the information well. Here are some of the challenges you may encounter.\nThe first challenge is understanding all of the different types of reports available. There are sales reports, inventory reports, performance reports, and more. It can be difficult to know which report you need to look at to get the information you need.\nAnother challenge is that some of the reports are not updated in real time. This can make it difficult to track your progress and see how your business is doing.\nFinally, some of the reports can be confusing or difficult to interpret. This can make it challenging to spot trends or identify areas that need improvement.\nDespite these challenges, it is important to review your Vendor Central reports regularly. Consider signing up for third-party software to analyze your brand reports. Doing so can help you track your progress, spot trends, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nVisual COGS Reports; The Best Way Forward\n\n\nAll Amazon Vendors know the challenges of tracking their brand's performance and organizing all the data that entails. It’s even more difficult to use that data to make informed decisions. In these situations, Visual COGS is your one stop destination.\nVisual COGS is the first step to revamping your strategy and growing your business on Amazon.

{"prompt":"The Importance of Amazon’s Detail Page Content ->","completion":" As an Amazon vendor or seller, having well-written and informative product detail page content is crucial for the success of your business on Amazon. The product detail page is the main source of information for potential customers, and it can have a big impact on their decision to purchase your product.\nHere are a few reasons why product detail page content is important on Amazon:\nIt helps to improve the visibility of your product.

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4. If you exclusively sell online, make sure you have a product website and that you can link your existing online store with Costco.com.

{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing.

Thus, it is important for customers to easily find the vendor offering the best value and customer service. There are several factors that Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm uses to select the winning Buy Box vendor.\n\n\nLet's Dive Deep and Crack Amazon’s Buy Box Algorithm\n\n\n· Inventory\n\n\nInventory is an important factor for the Buy Box Algorithm. Just selling the product won’t help; you also need to focus on inventory management to succeed. Amazon prefers sellers who have sufficient inventory to fulfill customers’ demands. i.e., the sellers with high sales records, big inventory, and good stock background can achieve higher Buy Box shares. Thus, it is important to keep an eye on inventory levels and check them frequently.\n\n\n· Performance\n\n\nWhen determining the Buy Box winner, Amazon analyzes the vendor’s performance, including cancellation rate, late shipments, reviews, etc. If you want to improve the chances of winning the Buy Box, it is essential to keep track of your performance index. Tracking performance can be overwhelming and time-consuming when running a business. VisualCOGS.com can pinpoint even the smallest changes in performance that are costing you the Buy Box, so you don’t have to.\n\n\n· Product state\n\n\nAmazon’s Buy Box Algorithm checks whether the product sold by the vendor is in perfect condition or not. If it finds the products are used or damaged, this will lower your chance of winning the Buy Box. Make sure your customers always receive high-quality, undamaged products.\n\n\n· Product cost\n\n\nAmazon carefully examines the cost of your product. It is important to offer a competitive price with shipping included while considering the product’s total cost. If you offer a low price with high shipping charges, you might end up losing the Buy Box, decreasing your product sales and increasing unsold inventory.\n\n\n· Dispatch time\n\n\nConsidering the importance of customer satisfaction, the vendor must offer fast and reliable dispatch. Therefore, the Buy Box Algorithm compares the actual dispatch time to the committed dispatch time as a major factor in determining the Buy Box winner.\n\n\n· Reviews\n\n\nAnother factor that contributes to winning the Buy Box is customer reviews. This includes positive, negative, or neutral reviews. To win Amazon’s Buy Box, you need to have positive reviews. If your customers are happy and satisfied with the services you provide, you will have good and positive reviews from them.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Sales with Six Simple Steps to Win the Amazon Buy Box\n\n\nIt is not easy for just any vendor to win Amazon’s Buy Box. The vendor must have an exceptional journey with customers, and it must be evident that customer satisfaction is a priority. Here are some of the best ways to consistently own the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Fulfillment\n\n\nWhen a customer places an order on Amazon, Amazon sends the order to the vendor. Then the vendor can directly ship the order to the end customer rather than sending it to Amazon and Amazon will reimburse the vendor for the orders shipped. This method is called Amazon Direct Fulfillment. Instead of delivering goods in bulk to Amazon warehouses, the vendor will ship individual products to the customers.\n\n\n· Shipping Time\n\n\nThe amount of time a vendor takes to ship a product is called shipping time. It is one of the major factors that contribute to a good customer satisfaction rate. This metric is even more important when the product ordered is perishable.\n\n\n· Landed Price\n\n\nAmazon has two prices, the price listed by the vendor for a product and the final price that includes shipping, also known as the landed price. The Buy Box shows the landed price to the customers. It is assumed that the lowest landed price has a high chance of winning Amazon's Buy Box, but this is not completely true.\n\n\nAmazon shows the most competitive offers, which may not be the lowest price for the listing. If a vendor's performance is better than their competitors', they can have a higher price and still win Amazon's Buy Box.\n\n\n· Availability of Stock\n\n\nA vendor needs to maintain a healthy inventory. If the product is out of stock, the Buy Box will generally rotate to another vendor. There are, however, conditions to the above statement i.e., if the product is listed as back-ordered. Back-ordered products vying to win the Buy Box must include a note on the product page letting customers know that the product will be shipped at a later date as it is not available immediately. Though immediately available products are preferred, back-ordered products can be featured in the Buy Box.\n\n\n· Order Defect Rate (ODR)\n\n\nIt is hard for vendors to win Amazon's Buy Box if they have a history of order defects. Both short and long-term order defect rates are considered when it comes to winning the Buy Box. The ODR includes the service chargeback rate, negative feedback rating, and guarantee claim rate. All three metrics are calculated to get the number of defective orders. A vendor’s ODR should always be below 1%.\n\n\n· Valid Tracking Rate (VTR)\n\n\nTo protect the Buy Box, it is important to keep a record of a valid tracking rate. VTR is calculated as the total packages shipped with valid tracking. It should be provided for 95% of packages. If it is less than this, it can affect the chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\nVisual COGS: We’ll Help You Win Amazon's Buy Box\n\n\nKnowing Amazon's policies, understanding the pricing strategy, projecting the market demands, meeting customers’ expectations, and observing competitors— is not easy. However, these are required to maintain ownership of the Buy Box. Winning and maintaining the Buy Box demands monitoring and understanding the abundance of complex data.\n\n\nAsk any vendor about the most challenging part of winning Amazon's Buy Box. The most common answer will be to manage all the aspects to stay ahead of other sellers. It is a huge hassle for vendors to keep track of everything on their own.\n\n\nWhat if there was a platform that gives you a complete insight into the required data and maintains it for you?\n\n\nVisual COGS provides you with data analytics, visual reports, and comprehensive dashboards—essentially, we do the hard work for you.\n\n\nOur dashboards give you Buy Box insights such as daily changes, MAP violations, Buy Box winners, other sellers, and price history so you’ll never be caught off guard.

But the e-commerce firms that inject big data analytics (BDA) into their value chain, experience 5–6% higher productivity than their competitors.\n\n\nThese firms never rely on raw data; instead, they use visual insights and advanced data analytics to fuel their growth.\n\n\nMost e-commerce sellers and vendors make serious mistakes and leave out valuable business opportunities due to their dependence on confusing chunks of raw data.\n\n\nDon’t make the same mistakes and leave valuable opportunities hidden in the dark just because you have fallen in love with spreadsheets.\n\n\nAt Visual COGS we are here to do all the heavy lifting for you.

{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}

{"prompt":"Is Your Product CRAP? Dive Deep into Net PPM to Find Out! ->","completion":" \n\nProfitability is a top concern in any business, and Amazon is no exception,  so to increase your sales velocity, it's important to assist Amazon by increasing its profit. The metric Net PPM (Net Pure Profit Margin) will help you gauge Amazon’s profitability across your products.\nBeing an active Amazon vendor, the quality of your products and your marketing tactics are crucial. However, your company is more intricate than that.\nIt’s important to go through Net PPM reports frequently to determine the profit  Amazon is making by selling your products and how that may be impacting your sales velocity.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nNet PPM helps you determine Amazon's level of profitability when selling your products. If a product’s Net PPM falls, Amazon sees less profit and may discontinue selling it. Thus, the product will be categorized as CRAP (Can't Realize A Profit).\nNet PPM is a crucial measure since it improves your vendor scorecard and serves as the main focus of discussion when you meet with Amazon to negotiate price increases. The greater the Net PPM for your products, the more money Amazon is making from you. As a result, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate for pricing in the future.\n\n\nThere are a few key places where Net PPM can be leveraged\nUnderstand the overall profitability: By tracking Net PPM over time, you can get a clear picture of the profit Amazon is making from your products and identify products that need improvement.\nMedia eligibility analysis: Media campaigns will immediately cease for unprofitable, low Net PPM ASINs marked as \"Ineligible ASINs.\" Since you can no longer support products with Amazon media, it can harm consumer acquisition and sales.\nNegotiate better terms: As an Amazon vendor, you don't have any control over pricing. However, if Amazon is making a profit with a healthy Net PPM from your products, you may have a stronger position to negotiate price increases for Amazon.\n\n\nTips for maintaining healthy PPM\nTrack gains and losses across your product catalog and be ready to invest in products with low Net PPM numbers if you want to save them from being listed as CRAP.\nAs a vendor, you can always offer Amazon your products at lower prices to increase its profits on them.\nYou can also offer bulk buys to Amazon at discounted prices for products with low Net PPM and close to getting listed as CRAP.\nYou must use a reliable tool like Visual COGS to successfully manage the Net PPM records for all your products.\n\n\nHow can Visual COGS assist you in staying current on your Net PPM?\nVisual COGS is an excellent platform to get insights into how things like the average selling price impact Net PPM so you can successfully negotiate price increases.

{"prompt":"Maximizing Profitability: Data for Price Increases on Amazon ->","completion":" \n\nAmazon Vendors can use Average Selling Price and Net Product Margin to advocate for price increases with their Vendor Manager by providing data that shows the financial performance of their products.\n\n\nAverage Selling Price (ASP) is the average price at which a product sells on Amazon. By tracking the ASP of their products, vendors can see if they are selling at a competitive price compared to similar products in the market. If the ASP is lower than the industry average, vendors can use this data to show that they need to increase their prices to remain competitive.\nNet Pure Product Margin (PPM) is the profit margin Amazon earned on a product after accounting for all costs associated with that product. By tracking PPM, vendors can see how much profit Amazon is earning on each product. If PPM is high, it can indicate that Amazon can tolerate a price increase and retain profitability.\n\n\nWhen advocating for a price increase, vendors should present data on both ASP and PPM to their Vendor Manager. By showing that the ASP is lower than the industry average and that PPM is high, vendors can make a compelling case for a price increase.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that vendors can also advocate for price increases by showing how they are providing value to Amazon and its customers through things such as innovation, better quality products, or exceptional customer service.\n\n\nWith Visual COGS, vendors can have a powerful tool that tracks both ASP and Net PPM, providing them with the data they need to successfully advocate for price increases.

{"prompt":"Maximizing Profitability: Data for Price Increases on Amazon ->","completion":" \n\nAmazon Vendors can use Average Selling Price and Net Product Margin to advocate for price increases with their Vendor Manager by providing data that shows the financial performance of their products.\n\n\nAverage Selling Price (ASP) is the average price at which a product sells on Amazon. By tracking the ASP of their products, vendors can see if they are selling at a competitive price compared to similar products in the market. If the ASP is lower than the industry average, vendors can use this data to show that they need to increase their prices to remain competitive.\nNet Pure Product Margin (PPM) is the profit margin Amazon earned on a product after accounting for all costs associated with that product. By tracking PPM, vendors can see how much profit Amazon is earning on each product. If PPM is high, it can indicate that Amazon can tolerate a price increase and retain profitability.\n\n\nWhen advocating for a price increase, vendors should present data on both ASP and PPM to their Vendor Manager. By showing that the ASP is lower than the industry average and that PPM is high, vendors can make a compelling case for a price increase.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that vendors can also advocate for price increases by showing how they are providing value to Amazon and its customers through things such as innovation, better quality products, or exceptional customer service.\n\n\nWith Visual COGS, vendors can have a powerful tool that tracks both ASP and Net PPM, providing them with the data they need to successfully advocate for price increases. It is an all-in-one Amazon Vendor Central solution that provides charts, graphs, and other features to help vendors monitor the financial performance of their products, and make data-driven decisions about pricing. This can give vendors an edge in negotiations with their Vendor Manager, and help them to maintain profitability while providing the best prices to customers."}
{"prompt":"How to Beat Your Competition on Amazon in Just Five Steps ->","completion":" Tens of thousands of products have the opportunity to appear in the top search results on Amazon each day. That seems like a lot until you consider there are 500,000 to 600,000 active sellers in the US and Canada alone.\n\n\nProducts that do not appear on the first page have a significantly lower chance of being seen by potential buyers. Worse yet, some shoppers never scroll past the top three listings.\nThere are many hurdles to overcome to get your products on the first page. Our goal at Visual COGS is to help you understand these hurdles and overcome them.\n\n\nBelow I have listed five steps to help you beat your competition in 2022.\n\n\nStep 1 - Identify Your Competition\nIdentifying your competition is the first step towards beating your competition.\n\n\nKnowing your competitors makes it easy to differentiate yourself from them.\n\n\nLet’s say I am selling handmade bags. Choosing the term “machine-made bags” to find the competition may not be the right thing to do.\nThe best way to find your direct competition is to search for your own products like a customer would.\nFind relevant keywords (use Google Keyword Planner)\nSearch each keyword on Amazon\nFilter them based on: Features, Price, and Ratings\nYes, this is time-consuming, but you’ll have a list of your competition in the end.\n\n\nIf you don’t have time for all this, use Visual COGS to find your direct competitors.\nStep 2 - Track Your Competition\nSo, now you know your direct competitors.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nLet’s be honest with each other.\n\n\nWhat drives sales?\n\n\nIt’s a great customer experience, isn’t it?\n\n\nIf your competitors have a better Best Seller Rank (BSR), it’s because they have better images, videos, A+ pages,  ratings, reviews, and so on.\nSo, identify every minute detail that makes their customer experience better than yours.\nStart with:\nRatings and Reviews\nPricing\nImages\nVideos\nA+ Content\nTitle\nDescription\nBullet Points\nAfter brainstorming everything you can to improve your listing, use Visual COGS to discover what you have missed.\nStep 3 - Set Price Alerts\nPricing can be a tricky game on Amazon. You want to make sure you're competitive but you also need to ensure that your products are profitable.\n\n\nThe right pricing strategy can boost your sales but it can also become a nightmare if it goes wrong.\n\n\nPrice is a major factor that consumers consider when making purchase decisions. Being able to offer a lower price than your competition can be the deciding factor in winning sales.\n\n\nThe most common method of lowering prices for products sold on Amazon is a low-cost supplier. However, sometimes the lowest cost isn't good enough to take away market share from your competition.\n\n\nUse Visual COGS to track price fluctuations across daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly trends and make smart decisions to grow your business exponentially.\n\n\n\n\nTip:  Visual COGS also helps you visualize your product’s sales history with simple exportable graphs. It even sends you daily emails covering price changes, review updates, availability alerts, and much more.\nStep 4 - Win More Buy Boxes\nWinning the Buy Box means that when the customer purchases an item, they purchase it from you.\n\n\n82% of all sales on Amazon happen through its Buy Box. If your product offer is not in the Buy Box, there is a diminishing chance that customers will purchase from you.\n\n\nMany factors contribute to winning the Buy Box: price, shipping time, fulfillment method, feedback score, helpful keywords, etc.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that all these factors influence your chances of winning the Buy Box. I have picked four that are favored by Amazon’s algorithms and have the highest Buy Box impact.\nUsing Fulfillment By Amazon\nAccording to Amazon’s help page, if you are an Amazon FBA seller, you are already eligible to be featured in the Buy Box. This gives a tremendous competitive advantage to FBA sellers\n\n\n2. Seller Ratings\n\n\nAmazon has a 0 to 100 rating system for sellers. The higher your rating, the better your chances of winning the Buy Box.\n\n\n3. Landed Price\n\n\nWhile having a lower landed price will increase your chance of winning the Buy Box, seller performance is a factor as well. If your seller performance is higher than your competition, you may be able to raise your price and still win the Buy Box.\n\n\n4. Shipping Time\n\n\nThe faster you can ship your products, the stronger the impact you will have on winning the Buy Box. Especially when you are selling products like groceries and birthday presents since customers look for faster delivery here.\nStep 5 - Ratings and Reviews\nGive customers a reason to leave a good review for your products.\n\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\n\nBut it’s not that easy.\n\n\nWhen you are trying to compete in a marketplace like Amazon, try to win the Box but think out of the box.\n\n\nYou might already know that if customers have to decide between two products with the same rating, they will buy the one with more positive reviews.\n\n\nSo, get more:\nEnroll in the Amazon vine program. It’s a great way to get reviews from the most trusted reviewers (Vine voices) on Amazon.\nAlong with that:\nUse Amazon’s “Request a Review” button.\nSend a personalized review request email.\nJust getting more reviews is not enough. Use Visual COGS to visualize your review timeline and make data-driven decisions based on review keywords, reviewers, and customer satisfaction scores.\nConclusion\nBeating your competition in a highly competitive marketplace like Amazon is not easy. Even if you try to do everything right, one small factor overlooked is good enough to lose your rankings and competitive advantage.\n\n\nYou know how powerful and influential data is to e-com businesses. Most sellers and vendors waste days collecting raw data in spreadsheets and are left with no time to upscale their business.\n\n\nWe don’t want that to happen to you. Here at Visual COGS, we are on a mission to help e-com sellers use the power of data to their advantage and save their valuable time.\n\n\nOur product helps you gain a complete view of your business with actionable insights, advanced analytics, and much more, all in a user-friendly interface with comprehensive dashboards.\n\n\nWatch the demo video now.\n\n"}

SEO helps create frequent, recurring, and free traffic for your website.\n\n\nWhen it comes to e-commerce websites, vivid product descriptions, customer reviews, and attractive product pictures will help bring in customers.\n\n\nMost online businesses make use of paid advertisements and social media marketing. There is nothing wrong with it, but it has a few drawbacks. You will need a continuous stream of revenue for generating Ads and persistent effort to attract your targeted audience.\n\n\nWhen it comes to SEO, it requires a one-time effort in advance without recurring expenses. Once your site gets ranked, the sales increase automatically.\n\n\nHowever, most newly set-up online businesses pay little or no attention to SEO strategies.\n\n\nVarious studies indicate that search accounts for most traffic of websites. A study by Outbrain showed that organic search beat social media by more than 300%.\n\n\nNow that we have a brief idea about SEO, let's get to the strategies.\nListing the Most Effective E-commerce SEO Strategies\nHere are a few key aspects for the best SEO strategy for E-commerce sites.\n\n\nE-commerce Keyword Analysis and Research\n\n\n\n\nThe first step to SEO campaigns is keyword research and analysis.\n\n\nThis is the most important step for developing the SEO strategy since\n1.  It will influence and inform all the other SEO tasks.\n2.  You will get target keywords that make it easy to rank.\n3.  The conversion rate is high and the search volume is satisfactory.\n4.  It is the key to unveiling the buyer's intent.\n\n\nHOW TO CONDUCT A KEYWORD RESEARCH FOR E-COMMERCE?\nThere are 3 ways to do keyword research for discovering keyword difficulty, search volume, and buyer intent- Amazon, competitor research, and SEO tools.\nAmazon: Whenever a user intends to buy a product, they go and search it on Amazon. This makes it a great resource for high buyer intent keywords. Amazon search tools also help in this process and provide free searches each day. Suppose you are setting up a small business for personalized gift items. You can start typing the seed keyword and get the keyword ideas. You can save them in your notes or a spreadsheet.\nResearching your competitors’ keywords: You can also use Google’s search engine to find high-ranking websites and derive keyword ideas from them. However, make sure that you don’t use the exact keywords blindly.\nUsing SEO tools and checkers: You can also make use of the various SEO tools available for boosting your campaigns.\nE-Commerce Website Architecture\nAfter you know the information you need, the next important aspect is your website’s architecture.\n\n\nHere are a few rules for a good site structure:\nYour e-commerce website should be simple to use and navigate.\nAny page should not be more than three clicks away from the current page.\nHave good content on your homepage, link to all product categories, and featured products.\n\n\n\n\nWhile building your website, make sure that your website has good performance. If your site takes more time than usual to load and reload, your traffic will decline.\nOn-page Optimization for E-commerce sites\nOn-page optimization is a way of certifying that your keywords fall in the right places and Google knows what your site is about.\nThere are three On-page SEO strategies for E-commerce websites.\nOn-page SEO for category pages\nOn-page SEO for product pages\nOn-page SEO for blogs\nFor this particular aspect, you should make sure that you include the target keyword in the\nMeta Title\nAlt Tag\nURL\nPage Title\nPage Headers and Subheaders\nProduct Description\nTechnical Audits for E-commerce websites\nTechnical SEO is one of those things that’s important for ALL sites… but doubly so for e-commerce. That’s because e-commerce sites tend to have LOTS of pages. And all of those pages increase the changes that technical SEO issues will crop up.\n\n\nNot only that, but most e-commerce pages don’t have that many backlinks pointing to them. This means that technical SEO is often the “tiebreaker” on Google’s first page. For example, if you and your competitor are neck-and-neck, a technical SEO issue can be the difference between the 4th spot and a coveted #1 ranking.\n\n\nHere are other SEO tools you can use for e-commerce site audits:\nSEMrush\nDeepCrawl\nScreamingFrog\nSite Condor\nSignificance of Content Marketing\n\n\nThe right content marketing strategy can help you get loads of targeted traffic and sales. You can achieve this through the three-fold method discussed below.\n\n\nExplore Your Target Customers Online\nHanging out with your customers gives you incredible insight into their thoughts, dreams, fears, and desires. Because it’s not always possible to hang out with customers in real life, I recommend going to places where they tend to hang out online.\n\n\nFor example, if your target audience is pet lovers, then you’d like to visit places like Reddit’s dog lovers’ or cat owners' community.\n\n\nUnderstand the Words and Phrases Your Target Customers Use\nNow that you’ve found your target audience, watch out for terms and phrases that they use to describe their issues and concerns.\nThese phrases represent keywords that your audience uses when they’re NOT shopping for products. These make great keywords for you to create blog content around.\n\n\nCreate Content Around That Keyword\nNow it’s time to create an engaging piece of content that’s the most definitive, useful, and absolute best on Earth.\nWhen you publish engaging content consistently on your e-commerce website, you’ll notice that all of these links, social media shares, and growing traffic, assist your product and category pages to rank better.\nHow Visual COGS can Help you Grow\nIn the arena of cut-throat competition, it is difficult to catch the attention of your target customers.\n\n\nSEO is obviously one of the best strategies to gain the attention of your target audience and get recognized. However, it's also a time-consuming method that takes months to show results.\n\n\nSo, to design an SEO campaign you’ll need insights into the performance of your pages and listings, which you can achieve through e-commerce data analytics.

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4.

{"prompt":"How to Leverage E-commerce Analytics to Augment Sales ->","completion":" \n\nDue to the rapid evolution of digital transformation, businesses selling products online have seen a staggering amount of growth.\n\n\nThe drawback of this explosive growth is the rise of numerous competitors. E-commerce vendors and sellers must understand all the dimensions of e-commerce strategies to stay on top.\nIn e-commerce businesses, not only are your customers royalty, but they also have all the power you need to grow your business. The best way to do that is to leverage analytics to understand industry trends and customer data, thus boosting your sales and expanding your e-commerce business.\nWhat is E-commerce Analytics?\nE-commerce analytics is the process of compiling raw data and converting it into valuable insights that impact your online business allowing you to make data-driven decisions by understanding the shifts in customer behavior and trends.\n\n\nIt enables you to drive more online sales by extracting and processing crucial information across customers’ buying journeys, from discovery to conversion.\n\n\nWhy is E-commerce Analytics More Important Than Ever?\n\n\n\n\nResearch from Deloitte shows that 49% of respondents agreed that analytics enable them to make better decisions.\n\n\nTruly, Knowledge is Power!\n\n\nIn the midst of the era of digital transformation, the pandemic made us rethink our lifestyle choices. With lockdowns across the globe, online sales grew rapidly as customers changed their buying habits, a trend that will be around for a long time and is expected to keep growing.\n\n\nE-commerce sales in the US are set to surpass $1 trillion, making up 18% of total retail sales by 2024.\n\n\nBenefits of Analytics for E-commerce\nYou will reap several benefits from using e-commerce analytics for your online shop.\n\n\n\n\nOptimize Pricing\nEighty percent of people say that competitive pricing is the most important aspect of shopping online.\n\n\nE-commerce data analytics empowers you with actionable insights that help you visualize sales for each customer segment at a granular level.

You ended up liking their suggestions quite often, right?\n\n\nThis is the kind of relationship businesses need with their customers.\n\n\nThrough customer insights, you can personalize the interactions you have with your

{"prompt":"The Beginner’s Guide for Costco Vendors ->","completion":" Do you own an established brand, or are you just looking to sell an item on Costco?\n\n\nIf your answer’s yes, this blog is written just for you!\n\n\nCostco is second only to Walmart in sales of various household commodities, according to 2015 figures.\n\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation started as Price Club by selling organic groceries, prime and choice beef, and rotisserie meat in July 1976 in San Diego.\n\n\nIn 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which was created on the warehouse model to become Price\/Costco. After that, it went through several name changes before finalizing on Costco Companies, Inc. Now, it's one of the largest membership warehouse clubs with a range of top-quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\nCostco's Distribution Channels\nUnlike Amazon, a Costco brick-and-mortar store or an online Costco Shop sells only name-brand products. It's a marketplace where you can sell your items, manage your advertisements, or change your listings.\n\n\nYou have two choices as a Costco Vendor:\nUse Costco.com to market your products.\nSell your products in Costco's brick-and-mortar stores, known as Costco Wholesale.\nIf you're lucky and meet the appropriate conditions, you can do both!\n\n\nProduct Categories at Costco Online and Brick-and-Mortar Stores\nHere are some of the product categories of Costco online and brick-and-mortar stores, in addition to their in-store assortment of fresh produce from grocery stores, seasonal items, and deli meals:\nElectronics\nComputers\nAppliances\nFurniture & Mattresses\nTires & Auto\nFloral, Gifts, & Tickets\nJewelry & Watches\nPatio, Lawn, & Garden\nHome Improvement\nHome & Kitchen\nOffice Products\nClothing & Luggage\nHealth & Beauty Products\nBaby, Kids, & Toys\nGrocery, Household, & Pet\nSports & Fitness, etc.\nWhat is the Costco Shop Known For?\n\n\n\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing excellent value and service. Costco's name is associated with quality products, warehouse prices, and bulk value for Costco's customers. Its warehouses are stocked with valued brands at below-market price-per-unit prices.\n\n\nFrom Costco's financial reports, here are a few crucial details regarding its customers:\nThe quality of the products and the sale price below the regular price are the main draws for shoppers.\nCostco's net sales in 2022 within the first 24 weeks increased by 16.4 percent, from $86.23 billion in the previous year to $100.35 billion.\nCostco's member renewal percentage in 2019 was a record-breaking 91% in the United States and Canada and 88% globally.\nYounger Costco shoppers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other devices to shop and communicate with Costco vendors via social media.\nOnline Sales on Costco\nTo understand what Costco sells at Costco shops and what they sell online, we have to look at the decision-makers' strategies. Let's take a look at the fiscal records of Costco to narrow down their requirements for vendors:\nCostco doesn't need your entire line of products. They only want fast-selling products that attract customers.\nThe in-store shelves at Costco Wholesale are your main competitors. They carry around 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, giving their customers a broad range of products.\nCostco does have terms that you need to follow regarding private labels. The quality of the product should be up to Costco's standards, and the Costco Vendor must fulfill the demand.\nWhat matters is that you bring a value proposition to Costco; it doesn't matter if you are a brand or a Costco Vendor. This will immensely help you especially if you want to reach in-store customers.\n\n\nThere are some things that you should keep in mind before making a proposition to Costco about an item to be sold online:\nYou must provide up to a 15% discount on the price tag of your products compared to your competitors.\nYour product packaging must be unique and must be produced in bulk.\nThough this may irritate your other distributors, you must understand that Costco may not consider it if your product is sold at the same price as Target and is not bulk-packed.\n\n\nThings to Know Before Selling on Costco\nSellers on Costco Wholesale or the online Costco Shop are called Costco Vendors or suppliers. To be a Costco Vendor, you must fulfill specific criteria:\n\n\nHumanitarian Values\nCostco completely forbids any treatment that can result in a violation of fundamental human rights. Your production must follow all the protocols to treat your workers humanely. There shouldn't be inhumane practices such as physical abuse or human trafficking. Your workers must be able to work in suitable workplace environments.\n\n\nCostco regularly sends a team of Social Responsibility Auditors who examine their vendors' premises and the work environment. Upon finding any discrepancies, the Costco vendor is given a warning and is asked to make appropriate changes. If the changes aren't made at the stipulated time, the Costco vendors are terminated.\n\n\nCostco Membership Needed\nCostco wholesale is a membership-based store. It doesn't matter if you’re a customer or a Costco vendor, you must become a Costco Member to receive the maximum benefits. Once you become a Costco member, you will enter the global Costco outlet.\n\n\nHere’s a list of a few requirements you need to fulfill before applying for one-year Costco Gold Star membership:\nYou must be over eighteen years for applying.\nYou must comply with Costco's Terms and Conditions, membership ethics, and privacy policies.\nYou must have a government-issued document of citizenship and identification.\nYou must pay the membership fee once every 12 months.\nBe Aware of the Sales Model\nCostco believes in supplying high-quality products to its customers at a lower price threshold. This means that their products usually get sold in bulk at a lower cost than the retail price. Therefore as a Costco Vendor, you must be aware of the demands to produce your products in bulk.\n\n\nBulk buys enable Costco to sell products at a lower price threshold. But if your wholesale sales price is higher than Costco expects, they might drop you from their list of vendors.\n\n\nAccording to Costco, your total Costco sales must not exceed 20% of your gross revenue. That means that you shouldn't rely on Costco's sales alone to sustain your business, and you'll need to make a price adjustment on the sale price (price dropping) to offer a bulk price.\n\n\nCostco's Channels for Shoppers\nThere are two different channels for a shopper to buy from Costco. The registered members are the only ones who can buy from Costco's Shop, while others can only access Costco products online.\n\n\nTherefore, to stay above any competition and get your products displayed on shelves, you must show that your product is a customer favorite. Your product should be marketable. This is why it's easier to get your products online where the sales are low compared to an offline Costco Shop.\n\n\nConditions for Becoming a Costco Vendor\nHere are a few conditions that you must fulfill before becoming a Costco Vendor:\nTo become an in-store brand in a Costco Shop, your product must be branded and have high sales in the market.\nFor Costco online, you must provide extensive information about your business and item.\nYour item must fulfill the quality standards of Costco to get a listing online. Costco usually sends a team of evaluators to look at your products.\nYou must also have a functioning website integrated with the online Costco site.\nYou must be able to produce bulk products because of Costco's sales model.\nHow to Become a Costco Vendor\nCostco has a few resources for a potential Costco Vendor on its website. There are two options available to a potential provider.\nYou can call the corporate office if you're selling non-food or sundry items.\nIf you are interested in selling food items, contact the appropriate division office.\nVisit their vendor contact page here, and read on to learn more about what to anticipate.\n\n\n1. After contacting the regional office, if they are interested in your goods, the division office may ask for a brief description of the products you want to offer and a quick overview of your organization. Prepare to get asked questions regarding the marketability of your items and other financial issues, as with any pitch.\n2. Your Costco Vendor application is given to the Category Buyer, who assesses the suitability of your product after meeting with the regional manager.\n3. If the Category Buyer approves your Costco vendor application, Costco will send a team of auditors to your manufacturing facilities to evaluate your work standards. If they don't discover any problems during the audit, you can begin selling.\n4.

Do you just buy the first dress you try on, go hopping from store to store trying on a plethora of dresses, or do you make an online purchase?\n\n\nMost customers explore multiple channels before making a final purchase. About 86% of shoppers regularly channel-hop across at least two channels. This is why successful brands adopt an omnichannel approach as one of their main strategies.\n\n\nIn a world where customers are the kings, omnichannel marketing has grown vital to implement a customer-centric mantra for your growing brand.\n\n\nWhat’s Omnichannel Marketing?\nOmnichannel marketing is the seamless integration of all online and offline touchpoints (physical stores and websites), branding, and messaging for an enhanced customer experience and a consistent brand experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of the omnichannel approach include buying online and picking up in-store or buying at the store and getting it delivered.\n\n\nAbout 87% of the retailers acknowledge the importance of omnichannel marketing strategy for their business. \n\n\nSo, How can you achieve this?\n\n\nThe goal is to ensure that each time your customers interact with your brand, across any channel, the message you’re trying to convey to them is consistent and relevant. Through omnichannel marketing, you can create:\nConsistent and engaging branding\nPersonalized messaging based on the customer’s interests\nDynamic content based on past interactions and the customer’s present buying stage.\n\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Omnichannel Marketing?\n\n\nEnhanced User Experience and Customer Satisfaction\nBusinesses using an omnichannel approach experience a 90% higher retention rate than businesses using single-channel campaigns.\n\n\nCustomers buy from brands they can trust. Omnichannel marketing enables brands to create a consistent user experience across multiple platforms. By providing a personalized user experience, the customer feels known and valued, which increases customer satisfaction, boosting loyalty and retention.\n\n\nCohesive Brand Identity\nAn omnichannel approach helps ensure consistency on cross-channel platforms. Not only does this help form a consistent and cohesive brand identity, but it also forms a strong brand recall. \n\n\nThis strengthened brand recall dramatically increases the probability of purchases across your customer base.\n\n\nMaximize Your ROI\nBy fostering brand loyalty, customer retention, strong brand recall, and enhanced customer satisfaction, you’ll be able to attract new customers through word-of-mouth marketing, good recommendations, and positive reviews. More customers mean more business, and therefore, more revenue.\n\n\nOmnichannel Trends to Watchout for in 2022\nMore people are shopping digitally than ever before. There are about 2.14 billion online shoppers, which account for almost 30% of the world’s population.\n\n\nTo keep up with the evolving marketplace and capture the attention of your customers, here are the six latest omnichannel trends to grow your business.\n\n\nBetter Personalization: The Key to Improved Customer Relationships\nAccording to a report by HubSpot, 79% of customers stated that personalized customer service is more significant than marketing.\n\n\nWhen your organization opts for an omnichannel marketing strategy, the most critical aspect is to put your customers' interests first. A personalized approach will gain you loyal customers and numerous referrals.\n\n\nMicrosoft revealed that 96% of customers say customer service is essential for loyalty to a particular brand. You can provide a personal touch by training your customer-facing team about the importance of personalized communication.

For example, the Customer Expectations Report of 2020 released by HubSpot revealed that 77% of your satisfied customers would refer others to your organization.\n\n\nAR Applications: Adding the ‘Element of Touch’\nOne of the best ways to give a personal touch is Augmented Reality (AR). It will help customers connect with your products, allowing them to imagine how these products will fit into their lives.\n\n\nSeveral brands like Shopify, Target, IKEA and The Home Depot have embedded AR in their customers' shopping experience. Here are some examples of how marketers apply AR technology.\nThey help you try on spectacles, sunglasses, apparel, and accessories to see if they suit you.\nFilters from social media let you test hair dye to see how you’ll look with a new color.\nApps give you a preview of how a particular piece of furniture, like a table or sofa, will fit into your living space.\nBrick-and-Mortar Space: Making a Comeback\nPhysical stores are here to stay. Many people still prefer in-person shopping. This provides an opportunity to establish your presence in local communities while adding another sales channel into the mix.\n\n\nAbout 89% of women and 78% of men who visit offline stores stated that they add extra items while they shop beyond their specified requirement. This shows that the trend of impulse buying is active and customers are more likely to add to their shopping cart once inside an offline shop.\n\n\nAround 59% of customers state that they’re likely to look at a product online and buy in-store.

Shoppable videos work the same way. They help promoters target particular segments without the advertisement feeling intrusive.\n\n\nContactless Transactions: Digital is the New Norm\nRetailers and brands design in-store applications to ensure contactless transactions. An in-store application provides a virtual shopping experience to its customers by encapsulating all essential functions in a suitable way.\n\n\nConsumers with many touchpoints will expect more options at each stage, from pickup options, delivery, and logistics to the point of purchases and social distancing protocols.\n\n\nApply Customer Data Offline: Nailing your Data-Driven Strategies\nA report by Harvard Business Review showed that 73% of the customers use multiple channels in their shopping journey.\n\n\nThe direct-to-customer brand always has the advantage of leveraging data to improve customer relationships. Applying leveraged customer data to other channels will create effective promotions, more conversions, improved product development information, and strengthen consumer relationships.\n\n\nResearch has shown nine out of 10 customers prefer the omnichannel experience.\nThe pandemic has brought significant changes in shopping behaviors and trends, which are likely to continue even after the threat of contagion is over. Providing a seamless and unified customer experience through omnichannel marketing is essential.\n\n\nTake Your Business to The Next Level\nTo leverage omnichannel marketing, the most crucial aspect is data collection and analytics, but without a team and the necessary infrastructure to translate data into actionable insights, it is all useless.\n\n\nVisual COGS is the ultimate analytics platform built to uncover valuable insights for e-commerce brands.
